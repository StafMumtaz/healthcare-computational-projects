2025,Innovations in Otolaryngology Using LLM for Early Detection of Sleep-Disordered Breathing.,SLAS technology,"Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), including conditions like Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), represents a major health concern, characterized by irregular  airflow during sleep due to airway obstruction. SDB can result in serious health  problems. Implementation of early intervention is vital whenever patient outcomes  are to be considered. This research aims to advance research on otolaryngology  using Machine Learning (ML) models, and Large Language Models (LLM) for  identification of SDB using Electronic Health Record (HER). The approach proposes  a hybrid ML framework combining the Dynamic Seagull Search algorithm-driven Large  Language model (DSS-LLM). The extensive clinical dataset is used to train the  model. It includes patient demographics, medical history, sleep habits,  comorbidities, and physical measurements. Data pre-processing involves handling  missing values, applying NLP techniques, and normalization. Feature extraction is  done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the  hyperparameters and finally for selecting the best set of predictors. The  extracted features are then used to train the proposed DSS-LLM model, which  incorporates the DSS algorithm to optimize the LLM classifier, improving  classification accuracy and model robustness. Subsequently, the idea of LLM is  introduced for its application on textual clinical records comprising physicians'  reports and patients' symptoms. The findings from an experiment suggest that the  proposed model enhances the classification accuracy achieved to 98.91 %,  precision attained by 98.9 %, recall achieved to 98.92 % and F-1 score attained  by 98.58 % as compared to the models developed earlier. This research provides a  novel solution to the screening of OSA at the pre-clinical level which involves  hybrid machine learning models integrated with LLMs. This proposed framework is  expected to boost clinical judgment and thereby increase better ophthalmology  outcomes for patients.",0
2025,"Comparison of ChatGPT-4, Copilot, Bard and Gemini Ultra on an Otolaryngology Question Bank.",Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of Google Bard, Microsoft Copilot, GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4) and Gemini Ultra on the OTO Chautauqua, a student-created,  faculty-reviewed otolaryngology question bank. STUDY DESIGN: Comparative  performance evaluation of different LLMs. SETTING: N/A. PARTICIPANTS: N/A.  METHODS: Large language models (LLMs) are being extensively tested in medical  education. However, their accuracy and effectiveness remain understudied,  particularly in otolaryngology. This study involved inputting 350  single-best-answer multiple choice questions, including 18 image-based questions,  into four LLMS. Questions were sourced from six independent question banks  related to (a) rhinology, (b) head and neck oncology, (c) endocrinology, (d)  general otolaryngology, (e) paediatrics, (f) otology, (g) facial plastics,  reconstruction and (h) trauma. LLMs were instructed to provide an output  reasoning for their answers, the length of which was recorded. RESULTS: Aggregate  and subgroup analysis revealed that Gemini (79.8%) outperformed the other LLMs,  followed by GPT-4 (71.1%), Copilot (68.0%), and Bard (65.1%) in accuracy. The  LLMs had significantly different average response lengths, with Bard  (x̄ = 1685.24) being the longest and no difference between GPT-4 (x̄ = 827.34)  and Copilot (x̄ = 904.12). Gemini's longer responses (x̄ =1291.68) included  explanatory images and links. Gemini and GPT-4 correctly answered image-based  questions (n = 18), unlike Copilot and Bard, highlighting their adaptability and  multimodal capabilities. CONCLUSION: Gemini outperformed the other LLMs in terms  of accuracy, followed by GPT-4, Copilot and Bard. GPT-4, although it has the  second-highest accuracy, provides concise and relevant explanations. Despite the  promising performance of LLMs, medical learners should cautiously assess accuracy  and decision-making reliability.",1
2025,"Leveraging FDA Labeling Documents and Large Language Model to Enhance Annotation, Profiling, and Classification of Drug Adverse Events with AskFDALabel.",Drug safety,"BACKGROUND: Drug adverse events (AEs) represent a significant public health concern. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labeling documents are an  essential resource for studying drug safety such as assessing a drug's likelihood  to cause certain organ toxicities; however, the manual extraction of AEs is  labor-intensive, requires specialized expertise, and is challenging to maintain,  due to frequent updates of the labeling documents. OBJECTIVE: To automate the  extraction of AE data from FDA drug labeling documents, we developed a workflow  based on AskFDALabel, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework, and its  demonstration in drug safety studies. METHODS: This framework incorporates a  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component based on FDALabel to enhance  standard LLM inference. Key steps include (1) selection of a task-specific  template, (2) FDALabel database querying, and (3) content preparation for LLM  processing. We evaluated the performance of the framework in three benchmark  experiments, including drug-induced liver injury (DILI) classification,  drug-induced cardiotoxicity (DICT) classification, and AE term recognition.  RESULTS: AskFDALabel achieved F1-scores of 0.978 for DILI, 0.931 for DICT, and  0.911 for AE annotation, outperforming other traditional methods. It also  provided cited labeling content and detailed explanations, facilitating manual  verification. CONCLUSION: AskFDALabel exhibited high consistency with human AE  annotation, particularly in classifying and profiling DILI and DICT. Thus, it can  significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of AE annotation, with  promising potential for advanced AE surveillance and drug safety research.",0
2024,Voice EHR: introducing multimodal audio data for health.,Frontiers in digital health,"INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on audio data may have the potential to rapidly perform clinical tasks, enhancing medical  decision-making and potentially improving outcomes through early detection.  Existing technologies depend on limited datasets collected with expensive  recording equipment in high-income countries, which challenges deployment in  resource-constrained, high-volume settings where audio data may have a profound  impact on health equity. METHODS: This report introduces a novel protocol for  audio data collection and a corresponding application that captures health  information through guided questions. RESULTS: To demonstrate the potential of  Voice EHR as a biomarker of health, initial experiments on data quality and  multiple case studies are presented in this report. Large language models (LLMs)  were used to compare transcribed Voice EHR data with data (from the same  patients) collected through conventional techniques like multiple choice  questions. Information contained in the Voice EHR samples was consistently rated  as equally or more relevant to a health evaluation. DISCUSSION: The HEAR  application facilitates the collection of an audio electronic health record  (""Voice EHR"") that may contain complex biomarkers of health from conventional  voice/respiratory features, speech patterns, and spoken language with semantic  meaning and longitudinal context-potentially compensating for the typical  limitations of unimodal clinical datasets.",1
2025,A foundation systematic review of natural language processing applied to gastroenterology & hepatology.,BMC gastroenterology,"OBJECTIVE: This review assesses the progress of NLP in gastroenterology to date, grades the robustness of the methodology, exposes the field to a new generation  of authors, and highlights opportunities for future research. DESIGN: Seven  scholarly databases (ACM Digital Library, Arxiv, Embase, IEEE Explore, Pubmed,  Scopus and Google Scholar) were searched for studies published between 2015 and  2023 that met the inclusion criteria. Studies lacking a description of  appropriate validation or NLP methods were excluded, as were studies  ufinavailable in English, those focused on non-gastrointestinal diseases and  those that were duplicates. Two independent reviewers extracted study  information, clinical/algorithm details, and relevant outcome data.  Methodological quality and bias risks were appraised using a checklist of quality  indicators for NLP studies. RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were identified  utilising NLP in endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal  bleeding, liver and pancreatic disease. Colonoscopy was the focus of 21 (38.9%)  studies; 13 (24.1%) focused on liver disease, 7 (13.0%) on inflammatory bowel  disease, 4 (7.4%) on gastroscopy, 4 (7.4%) on pancreatic disease and 2 (3.7%) on  endoscopic sedation/ERCP and gastrointestinal bleeding. Only 30 (56.6%) of the  studies reported patient demographics, and only 13 (24.5%) had a low risk of  validation bias. Thirty-five (66%) studies mentioned generalisability, but only 5  (9.4%) mentioned explainability or shared code/models. CONCLUSION: NLP can unlock  substantial clinical information from free-text notes stored in EPRs and is  already being used, particularly to interpret colonoscopy and radiology reports.  However, the models we have thus far lack transparency, leading to duplication,  bias, and doubts about generalisability. Therefore, greater clinical engagement,  collaboration, and open sharing of appropriate datasets and code are needed.",0

2025,Assessing adult sinusitis guidelines: A comparative analysis of AAO-HNS and AI Chatbots.,American journal of otolaryngology,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the guidelines offered by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNS) on adult sinusitis to  chatbots. METHODS: ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, Bard, and Llama 2 represent openly  accessible large language model-based chatbots. Accuracy, over-conclusiveness,  supplemental, and incompleteness of chatbot responses were compared to the  AAO-HNS Adult sinusitis clinical guidelines. RESULTS: 12 guidelines consisting of  30 questions from the AAO-HNS were compared to 4 different chatbots. Adherence to  AAO-HNS guidelines varied, with Llama 2 providing 80 % accurate responses, BARD  83.3 %, ChatGPT-4.0 80 %, and ChatGPT-3.5 73.3 %. Over-conclusive responses were  minimal, with only one instance each from Llama 2 and ChatGPT-4.0. However, rates  of incomplete responses varied, with Llama 2 exhibiting the highest at 40 %,  followed by ChatGPT-4.0 at 33.3 %, BARD at 23.3 %, and ChatGPT-3.5 at 36.7 %.  Fisher's Exact Test analysis revealed significant deviations from the guideline  standard, with less accuracy (p = 0.012 for Llama 2, p = 0.026 for BARD,  p = 0.012 for ChatGPT-4.0, p = 0.002 for ChatGPT-3.5), inclusion of supplemental  data (p < 0.001 for all), and less completeness (p < 0.01 for all) across all  chatbots, indicating potential areas for enhancement in their performance.  CONCLUSION: Although AI chatbots like Llama 2, Bard, and ChatGPT exhibit  potential in sharing health-related information, their present performance in  responding to clinical concerns concerning adult rhinosinusitis is not up to par  with recognized clinical criteria. Future revisions should focus on addressing  these shortcomings and placing an emphasis on accuracy, completeness, and  conformity with evidence-based practices.",1
2025,"Accuracy of remote, video-based supraventricular tachycardia detection in patients undergoing elective electrical cardioversion: a prospective cohort.",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,"Unobtrusive pulse rate monitoring by continuous video recording, based on remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), might enable early detection of perioperative  arrhythmias in general ward patients. However, the accuracy of an rPPG-based  machine learning model to monitor the pulse rate during sinus rhythm and  arrhythmias is unknown. We conducted a prospective, observational diagnostic  study in a cohort with a high prevalence of arrhythmias (patients undergoing  elective electrical cardioversion). Pulse rate was assessed with rPPG via a  visible light camera and ECG as reference, before and after cardioversion. A  cardiologist categorized ECGs into normal sinus rhythm or arrhythmias requiring  further investigation. A supervised machine learning model (support vector  machine with Gaussian kernel) was trained using rPPG signal features from 60-s  intervals and validated via leave-one-subject-out. Pulse rate measurement  performance was evaluated with Bland-Altman analysis. Of 72 patients screened, 51  patients were included in the analyses, including 444 60-s intervals with normal  sinus rhythm and 1130 60-s intervals of clinically relevant arrhythmias. The  model showed robust discrimination (AUC 0.95 [0.93-0.96]) and good calibration.  For pulse rate measurement, the bias and limits of agreement for sinus rhythm  were 1.21 [- 8.60 to 11.02], while for arrhythmia, they were - 7.45 [- 35.75 to  20.86]. The machine learning model accurately identified sinus rhythm and  arrhythmias using rPPG in real-world conditions. Heart rate underestimation  during arrhythmias highlights the need for optimization.",0
2025,"Assessment of decision-making with locally run and web-based large language models versus human board recommendations in otorhinolaryngology, head and neck  surgery.",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the  German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Tumor boards are a cornerstone of modern cancer treatment. Given their advanced capabilities, the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in  generating tumor board decisions for otorhinolaryngology (ORL) head and neck  surgery is gaining increasing attention. However, concerns over data protection  and the use of confidential patient information in web-based LLMs have restricted  their widespread adoption and hindered the exploration of their full potential.  In this first study of its kind we compared standard human multidisciplinary  tumor board recommendations (MDT) against a web-based LLM (ChatGPT-4o) and a  locally run LLM (Llama 3) addressing data protection concerns. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Twenty-five simulated tumor board cases were presented to an MDT  composed of specialists from otorhinolaryngology, craniomaxillofacial surgery,  medical oncology, radiology, radiation oncology, and pathology. This  multidisciplinary team provided a comprehensive analysis of the cases. The same  cases were input into ChatGPT-4o and Llama 3 using structured prompts, and the  concordance between the LLMs' and MDT's recommendations was assessed. Four MDT  members evaluated the LLMs' recommendations in terms of medical adequacy (using a  six-point Likert scale) and whether the information provided could have  influenced the MDT's original recommendations. RESULTS: ChatGPT-4o showed 84%  concordance (21 out of 25 cases) and Llama 3 demonstrated 92% concordance (23 out  of 25 cases) with the MDT in distinguishing between curative and palliative  treatment strategies. In 64% of cases (16/25) ChatGPT-4o and in 60% of cases  (15/25) Llama, identified all first-line therapy options considered by the MDT,  though with varying priority. ChatGPT-4o presented all the MDT's first-line  therapies in 52% of cases (13/25), while Llama 3 offered a homologous treatment  strategy in 48% of cases (12/25). Additionally, both models proposed at least one  of the MDT's first-line therapies as their top recommendation in 28% of cases  (7/25). The ratings for medical adequacy yielded a mean score of 4.7 (IQR: 4-6)  for ChatGPT-4o and 4.3 (IQR: 3-5) for Llama 3. In 17% of the assessments  (33/200), MDT members indicated that the LLM recommendations could potentially  enhance the MDT's decisions. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the capability  of both LLMs to provide viable therapeutic recommendations in ORL head and neck  surgery. Llama 3, operating locally, bypasses many data protection issues and  shows promise as a clinical tool to support MDT decisions. However at present,  LLMs should augment rather than replace human decision-making.",1

2025,Application of large language models in clinical record correction: a comprehensive study on various retraining methods.,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-based (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and Llama-2 models (13B and 7B  architectures), in autonomously assessing clinical records (CRs) to enhance  medical education and diagnostic skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various  techniques, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning (FT), and low-rank  adaptation (LoRA), were implemented and compared on Llama-2 7B. These methods  were assessed using prompts in both English and Spanish to determine their  adaptability to different languages. Performance was benchmarked against GPT-3.5,  GPT-4, and Llama-2 13B. RESULTS: GPT-based models, particularly GPT-4,  demonstrated promising performance closely aligned with specialist evaluations.  Application of FT on Llama-2 7B improved text comprehension in Spanish, equating  its performance to that of Llama-2 13B with English prompts. Low-rank adaptation  significantly enhanced performance, surpassing GPT-3.5 results when combined with  FT. This indicates LoRA's effectiveness in adapting open-source models for  specific tasks. DISCUSSION: While GPT-4 showed superior performance, FT and LoRA  on Llama-2 7B proved crucial in improving language comprehension and  task-specific accuracy. Identified limitations highlight the need for further  research. CONCLUSION: This study underscores the potential of LLMs in medical  education, providing an innovative, effective approach to CR correction. Low-rank  adaptation emerged as the most effective technique, enabling open-source models  to perform on par with proprietary models.

2025,Automated Evaluation of Antibiotic Prescribing Guideline Concordance in Pediatric Sinusitis Clinical Notes.,Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing,"BACKGROUND: Ensuring antibiotics are prescribed only when necessary is crucial for maintaining their effectiveness and is a key focus of public health  initiatives worldwide. In cases of sinusitis, among the most common reasons for  antibiotic prescriptions in children, healthcare providers must distinguish  between bacterial and viral causes based on clinical signs and symptoms. However,  due to the overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper  respiratory infections, antibiotics are often over-prescribed. OBJECTIVES:  Currently, there are no electronic health record (EHR)-based methods, such as lab  tests or ICD-10 codes, to retroactively assess the appropriateness of  prescriptions for sinusitis, making manual chart reviews the only available  method for evaluation, which is time-intensive and not feasible at a large scale.  In this study, we propose using natural language processing to automate this  assessment. METHODS: We developed, trained, and evaluated generative models to  classify the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions in 300 clinical notes  from pediatric patients with sinusitis seen at a primary care practice in the  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia network. We utilized standard prompt  engineering techniques, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought  prompting, to refine an initial prompt. Additionally, we employed  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to train a medium-sized generative model Llama 3  70B-instruct. RESULTS: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning did not enhance  performance, the combination of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting  proved beneficial. Our best results were achieved using the largest generative  model publicly available to date, the Llama 3.1 405B-instruct. On our evaluation  set, the model correctly identified 94.7% of the 152 notes where antibiotic  prescription was appropriate and 66.2% of the 83 notes where it was not  appropriate. However, 15 notes that were insufficiently, vaguely, or ambiguously  documented by physicians posed a challenge to our model, as none were accurately  classified. CONCLUSION: Our generative model demonstrated good performance in the  challenging task of chart review. This level of performance may be sufficient for  deploying the model within the EHR, where it can assist physicians in real-time  to prescribe antibiotics in concordance with the guidelines, or for monitoring  antibiotic stewardship on a large scale.",1

2024,Assessing the Role of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) in Alzheimer's Disease Management: Comparative Study of Neurologist- and Artificial  Intelligence-Generated Responses.,Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder posing challenges to patients, caregivers, and society. Accessible and accurate  information is crucial for effective AD management. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed  to evaluate the accuracy, comprehensibility, clarity, and usefulness of the  Generative Pretrained Transformer's (GPT) answers concerning the management and  caregiving of patients with AD. METHODS: In total, 14 questions related to the  prevention, treatment, and care of AD were identified and posed to GPT-3.5 and  GPT-4 in Chinese and English, respectively, and 4 respondent neurologists were  asked to answer them. We generated 8 sets of responses (total 112) and randomly  coded them in answer sheets. Next, 5 evaluator neurologists and 5 family members  of patients were asked to rate the 112 responses using separate 5-point Likert  scales. We evaluated the quality of the responses using a set of 8 questions  rated on a 5-point Likert scale. To gauge comprehensibility and participant  satisfaction, we included 3 questions dedicated to each aspect within the same  set of 8 questions. RESULTS: As of April 10, 2023, the 5 evaluator neurologists  and 5 family members of patients with AD rated the 112 responses: GPT-3.5: n=28,  25%, responses; GPT-4: n=28, 25%, responses; respondent neurologists: 56 (50%)  responses. The top 5 (4.5%) responses rated by evaluator neurologists had 4 (80%)  GPT (GPT-3.5+GPT-4) responses and 1 (20%) respondent neurologist's response. For  the top 5 (4.5%) responses rated by patients' family members, all but the third  response were GPT responses. Based on the evaluation by neurologists, the  neurologist-generated responses achieved a mean score of 3.9 (SD 0.7), while the  GPT-generated responses scored significantly higher (mean 4.4, SD 0.6; P<.001).  Language and model analyses revealed no significant differences in response  quality between the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models (GPT-3.5: mean 4.3, SD 0.7; GPT-4:  mean 4.4, SD 0.5; P=.51). However, English responses outperformed Chinese  responses in terms of comprehensibility (Chinese responses: mean 4.1, SD 0.7;  English responses: mean 4.6, SD 0.5; P=.005) and participant satisfaction  (Chinese responses: mean 4.2, SD 0.8; English responses: mean 4.5, SD 0.5;  P=.04). According to the evaluator neurologists' review, Chinese responses had a  mean score of 4.4 (SD 0.6), whereas English responses had a mean score of 4.5 (SD  0.5; P=.002). As for the family members of patients with AD, no significant  differences were observed between GPT and neurologists, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, or  Chinese and English responses.

2024,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to Increase the Readability of Patient Education Materials in Pediatric Otolaryngology.,"Ear, nose, & throat journal","Objectives: To identify the reading levels of existing patient education materials in pediatric otolaryngology and to utilize natural language processing  artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce the reading level of patient education  materials. Methods: Patient education materials for pediatric conditions were  identified from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery  (AAO-HNS) website. Patient education materials about the same conditions, if  available, were identified and selected from the websites of 7 children's  hospitals. The readability of the patient materials was scored before and after  using AI with the Flesch-Kincaid calculator. ChatGPT version 3.5 was used to  convert the materials to a fifth-grade reading level. Results: On average,  AAO-HNS pediatric education material was written at a 10.71 ± 0.71 grade level.  After requesting the reduction of those materials to a fifth-grade reading level,  ChatGPT converted the same materials to an average grade level of 7.9 ± 1.18 (P <  .01). When comparing the published materials from AAO-HNS and the 7 institutions,  the average grade level was 9.32 ± 1.82, and ChatGPT was able to reduce the  average level to 7.68 ± 1.12 (P = .0598). Of the 7 children's hospitals, only 1  institution had an average grade level below the recommended sixth-grade level.  Conclusions: Patient education materials in pediatric otolaryngology were  consistently above recommended reading levels. In its current state, AI can  reduce the reading levels of education materials. However, it did not possess the  capability to reduce all materials to be below the recommended reading level.",1
2025,Chasing sleep physicians: ChatGPT-4o on the interpretation of polysomnographic results.,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the  German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"BACKGROUND: From a healthcare professional's perspective, the use of ChatGPT (Open AI), a large language model (LLM), offers huge potential as a practical and  economic digital assistant. However, ChatGPT has not yet been evaluated for the  interpretation of polysomnographic results in patients with suspected obstructive  sleep apnea (OSA). AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the agreement of polysomnographic  result interpretation between ChatGPT-4o and a board-certified sleep physician  and to shed light into the role of ChatGPT-4o in the field of medical  decision-making in sleep medicine. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this  proof-of-concept study, 40 comprehensive patient profiles were designed, which  represent a broad and typical spectrum of cases, ensuring a balanced distribution  of demographics and clinical characteristics. After various prompts were tested,  one prompt was used for initial diagnosis of OSA and a further for patients with  positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy intolerance. Each polysomnographic result  was independently evaluated by ChatGPT-4o and a board-certified sleep physician.  Diagnosis and therapy suggestions were analyzed for agreement. RESULTS:  ChatGPT-4o and the sleep physician showed 97% (29/30) concordance in the  diagnosis of the simple cases. For the same cases the two assessment instances  unveiled 100% (30/30) concordance regarding therapy suggestions. For cases with  intolerance of treatment with positive airway pressure (PAP) ChatGPT-4o and the  sleep physician revealed 70% (7/10) concordance in the diagnosis and 44% (22/50)  concordance for therapy suggestions. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Precise  prompting improves the output of ChatGPT-4o and provides sleep physician-like  polysomnographic result interpretation. Although ChatGPT shows some shortcomings  in offering treatment advice, our results provide evidence for AI assisted  automation and economization of polysomnographic interpretation by LLMs. Further  research should explore data protection issues and demonstrate reproducibility  with real patient data on a larger scale.",0
2024,Gene expression changes in mouse lung induced by subacute inhalation of PM(10)-rich particulate matter.,Inhalation toxicology,"INTRODUCTION: Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is associated with an increased incidence of lung diseases, but the underlying mechanisms have not been  fully elucidated. In this study, a mouse model of subacute lung inflammation was  employed to investigate the cellular responses and gene expression changes  induced by exposure to natural ambient air pollution. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were  exposed to road dust (primarily PM10) at 150 µg/m³ for 21 days (8 h/day) through  a nose-only inhalation exposure system. Lung tissues were analyzed for the  expression of proinflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, and fibrosis markers.  RNA-sequencing analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes  (DEGs). A gene ontology over-representation analysis was performed to identify  the altered genetic pathways. RESULTS: Elevated levels of proinflammatory  cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and an increase in phosphorylated  MAPK were determined in the road dust exposure group compared to the control  group. Histopathological examinations revealed more severe lung inflammation and  damage in the exposed mice, including fibrosis and bronchiolar hyperplasia. Gene  expression profiling identified 108 DEGs, with decreases in most except genes  such as Krt15 and Reg3g. The protein-protein interaction network analysis  together with text-mining identified 18 key hub genes, associated with fatty acid  oxidation, lipid metabolism, and peroxisomes. CONCLUSION: This study identified  key genes, signaling pathways, and cellular responses in mouse lung affected by  road dust exposure. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the  transcriptional and cellular responses induced by subacute exposure to the PM in  road dust.",0

However, the quality and readability of such digitally generated  information remains understudied. This study is the first to compare the quality  and readability of digitally generated health information against leaflets  produced by professionals. METHODOLOGY:  Patient information leaflets from five  ENT UK leaflets and their corresponding ChatGPT responses were extracted from the  Internet. Assessors with various degrees of medical knowledge evaluated the  content using the Ensuring Quality Information for Patients (EQIP) tool and  readability tools including the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). Statistical  analysis was performed to identify differences between leaflets, assessors, and  sources of information. RESULTS:  ENT UK leaflets were of moderate quality,  scoring a median EQIP of 23. Statistically significant differences in overall  EQIP score were identified between ENT UK leaflets, but ChatGPT responses were of  uniform quality. Nonspecialist doctors rated the highest EQIP scores, while  medical students scored the lowest. The mean readability of ENT UK leaflets was  higher than ChatGPT responses. The information metrics of ENT UK leaflets were  moderate and varied between topics. Equivalent ChatGPT information provided  comparable content quality, but with reduced readability. CONCLUSION:  ChatGPT  patient information and professionally produced leaflets had comparable content,  but large language model content required a higher reading age. With the  increasing use of online health resources, this study highlights the need for a  balanced approach that considers both the quality and readability of patient  education materials.",1
2024,Cross-lingual Natural Language Processing on Limited Annotated Case/Radiology Reports in English and Japanese: Insights from the Real-MedNLP Workshop.,Methods of information in medicine,"BACKGROUND:  Textual datasets (corpora) are crucial for the application of natural language processing (NLP) models. However, corpus creation in the medical  field is challenging, primarily because of privacy issues with raw clinical data  such as health records. Thus, the existing clinical corpora are generally small  and scarce. Medical NLP (MedNLP) methodologies perform well with limited data  availability. OBJECTIVES:  We present the outcomes of the Real-MedNLP workshop,  which was conducted using limited and parallel medical corpora. Real-MedNLP  exhibits three distinct characteristics: (1) limited annotated documents: the  training data comprise only a small set (∼100) of case reports (CRs) and  radiology reports (RRs) that have been annotated. (2) Bilingually parallel: the  constructed corpora are parallel in Japanese and English. (3) Practical tasks:  the workshop addresses fundamental tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER)  and applied practical tasks. METHODS:  We propose three tasks: NER of ∼100  available documents (Task 1), NER based only on annotation guidelines for humans  (Task 2), and clinical applications (Task 3) consisting of adverse drug effect  (ADE) detection for CRs and identical case identification (CI) for RRs. RESULTS:  Nine teams participated in this study. The best systems achieved 0.65 and 0.89  F1-scores for CRs and RRs in Task 1, whereas the top scores in Task 2 decreased  by 50 to 70%. In Task 3, ADE reports were detected by up to 0.64 F1-score, and CI  scored up to 0.96 binary accuracy. CONCLUSION:  Most systems adopt  medical-domain-specific pretrained language models using data augmentation  methods. Despite the challenge of limited corpus size in Tasks 1 and 2, recent  approaches are promising because the partial match scores reached  ∼0.8-0.9 F1-scores. Task 3 applications revealed that the different  availabilities of external language resources affected the performance per  language.",0
2024,Automatic Identification of Hate Speech - A Case-Study of alt-Right YouTube Videos.,F1000Research,"BACKGROUND: Identifying hate speech (HS) is a central concern within online contexts. Current methods are insufficient for efficient preemptive HS  identification. In this study, we present the results of an analysis of automatic  HS identification applied to popular alt-right YouTube videos. METHODS: This  essay describes methodological challenges of automatic HS detection. The case  study concerns data on a formative segment of contemporary radical right  discourse. Our purpose is twofold. (1) To outline an interdisciplinary  mixed-methods approach for using automated identification of HS. This bridges the  gap between technical research on the one hand (such as machine learning, deep  learning, and natural language processing, NLP) and traditional empirical  research on the other. Regarding alt-right discourse and HS, we ask: (2) What are  the challenges in identifying HS in popular alt-right YouTube videos? RESULTS:  The results indicate that effective and consistent identification of HS  communication necessitates qualitative interventions to avoid arbitrary or  misleading applications. Binary approaches of hate/non-hate speech tend to force  the rationale for designating content as HS. A context-sensitive qualitative  approach can remedy this by bringing into focus the indirect character of these  communications. The results should interest researchers within social sciences  and the humanities adopting automatic sentiment analysis and for those analysing  HS and radical right discourse. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic identification or  moderation of HS cannot account for an evolving context of indirect  signification. This study exemplifies a process whereby automatic hate speech  identification could be utilised effectively. Several methodological steps are  needed for a useful outcome, with both technical quantitative processing and  qualitative analysis being vital to achieve meaningful results. With regard to  the alt-right YouTube material, the main challenge is indirect framing.  Identification demands orientation in the broader discursive context and the  adaptation towards indirect expressions renders moderation and suppression  ethically and legally precarious.",0

STUDY DESIGN: Review of online  material modified by AI. SETTING: Academic center. METHODS: Five handout  materials obtained from the American Rhinologic Society (ARS) and the American  Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery websites were assessed using  validated readability metrics. The handouts were inputted into OpenAI's ChatGPT-4  after prompting: ""Rewrite the following at a 6th-grade reading level."" The  understandability and actionability of both native and LLM-revised versions were  evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Results  were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: The mean readability scores  of the standard (ARS, American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive  Surgery) materials corresponded to ""difficult,"" with reading categories ranging  between high school and university grade levels. Conversely, the LLM-revised  handouts had an average seventh-grade reading level. LLM-revised handouts had  better readability in nearly all metrics tested: Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease  (70.8 vs 43.9; P < .05), Gunning Fog Score (10.2 vs 14.42; P < .05), Simple  Measure of Gobbledygook (9.9 vs 13.1; P < .05), Coleman-Liau (8.8 vs 12.6;  P < .05), and Automated Readability Index (8.2 vs 10.7; P = .06). PEMAT scores  were significantly higher in the LLM-revised handouts for understandability (91  vs 74%; P < .05) with similar actionability (42 vs 34%; P = .15) when compared to  the standard materials. CONCLUSION: Patient-facing handouts can be augmented by  ChatGPT with simple prompting to tailor information with improved readability.  This study demonstrates the utility of LLMs to aid in rewriting patient handouts  and may serve as a tool to help optimize education materials. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:  Level VI.",1
2024,Evaluating the Accuracy of ChatGPT in Common Patient Questions Regarding HPV+ Oropharyngeal Carcinoma.,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology","OBJECTIVES: Large language model (LLM)-based chatbots such as ChatGPT have been publicly available and increasingly utilized by the general public since late  2022. This study sought to investigate ChatGPT responses to common patient  questions regarding Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer  (OPC). METHODS: This was a prospective, multi-institutional study, with data  collected from high volume institutions that perform >50 transoral robotic  surgery cases per year. The 100 most recent discussion threads including the term  ""HPV"" on the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivors Network's Head and Neck  Cancer public discussion board were reviewed. The 11 most common questions were  serially queried to ChatGPT 3.5; answers were recorded. A survey was distributed  to fellowship trained head and neck oncologic surgeons at 3 institutions to  evaluate the responses. RESULTS: A total of 8 surgeons participated in the study.  For questions regarding HPV contraction and transmission, ChatGPT answers were  scored as clinically accurate and aligned with consensus in the head and neck  surgical oncology community 84.4% and 90.6% of the time, respectively. For  questions involving treatment of HPV+ OPC, ChatGPT was clinically accurate and  aligned with consensus 87.5% and 91.7% of the time, respectively. For questions  regarding the HPV vaccine, ChatGPT was clinically accurate and aligned with  consensus 62.5% and 75% of the time, respectively. When asked about circulating  tumor DNA testing, only 12.5% of surgeons thought responses were accurate or  consistent with consensus. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT 3.5 performed poorly with  questions involving evolving therapies and diagnostics-thus, caution should be  used when using a platform like ChatGPT 3.5 to assess use of advanced technology.  Patients should be counseled on the importance of consulting their surgeons to  receive accurate and up to date recommendations, and use LLM's to augment their  understanding of these important health-related topics.",1

This study evaluated general and deep learning  linguistic differences between the applicant genders over a 10-year span. STUDY  DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Two institutions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  PSs and LORs were collected from 2014 to 2023 from two institutions. The Valence  Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) natural language processing (NLP)  package was used to compare the positive or negative sentiment in LORs and PSs.  Next, the deep learning tool, Empath, categorized the text into scores, and  Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed for comparisons between applicant gender.  RESULTS: Among 177 applicants over 10 years, 120 were males and 57 were females.  There were no differences in word count or VADER sentiment scores between genders  for both LORs and PSs. However, among Empath sentiment categories, male  applicants had more words of trust ( p = 0.03) and leadership ( p = 0.002) in  LORs. Temporally, the trends show a consistently higher VADER sentiment and  Empath ""trust"" and ""leader"" in male LORs from 2014 to 2019, after which there was  no statistical significance in sentiment scores between genders, and females even  have higher scores of trust and leadership in 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Linguistic  content overall favored male applicants because they were more frequently  described as trustworthy and leaders.

2024,Mechanistic study of acupuncture on the pterygopalatine ganglion to improve allergic rhinitis: analysis of multi-target effects based on  bioinformatics/network topology strategie.,Briefings in bioinformatics,"One of the prevalent chronic inflammatory disorders of the nasal mucosa, allergic rhinitis (AR) has become more widespread in recent years. Acupuncture  pterygopalatine ganglion (aPPG) is an emerging alternative therapy that is used  to treat AR, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory  effects are unclear. This work methodically demonstrated the multi-target  mechanisms of aPPG in treating AR based on bioinformatics/topology using  techniques including text mining, bioinformatics, and network topology, among  others. A total of 16 active biomarkers and 108 protein targets related to aPPG  treatment of AR were obtained. A total of 345 Gene Ontology terms related to aPPG  of AR were identified, and 135 pathways were screened based on Kyoto Encyclopedia  of Genes and Genomes analysis. Our study revealed for the first time the  multi-targeted mechanism of action of aPPG in the treatment of AR. In animal  experiments, aPPG ameliorated rhinitis symptoms in OVA-induced AR rats; decreased  serum immunoglobulin E, OVA-sIgE, and substance P levels; elevated serum  neuropeptide Y levels; and modulated serum Th1/Th2/Treg/Th17 cytokine expression  by a mechanism that may be related to the inhibition of activation of the  TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. In vivo animal experiments once again  validated the results of the bioinformatics analysis.

For clinical recommendation, explanation and summarization ChatGPT 3.5  and 4.0 scored well, but demonstrated to be mostly an assisting tool, suggesting  significantly more therapy options than our MDT, while some of the recommended  treatment modalities like primary immunotherapy are not part of the current  treatment guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrates that advanced AI  models at the moment can merely assist in the MDT setting, since the current  versions list common therapy options, but sometimes recommend incorrect treatment  options and in the case of ChatGPT 3.5 lack information on the source material.",1
2024,Evaluating ChatGPT Responses on Atrial Fibrillation for Patient Education.,Cureus,"Background ChatGPT is a language model that has gained widespread popularity for its fine-tuned conversational abilities. However, a known drawback to the  artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot is its tendency to confidently present users  with inaccurate information. We evaluated the quality of ChatGPT responses to  questions pertaining to atrial fibrillation for patient education. Our analysis  included the accuracy and estimated grade level of answers and whether references  were provided for the answers. Methodology ChatGPT was prompted four times and 16  frequently asked questions on atrial fibrillation from the American Heart  Association were asked. Prompts included Form 1 (no prompt), Form 2  (patient-friendly prompt), Form 3 (physician-level prompt), and Form 4 (prompting  for statistics/references). Responses were scored as incorrect, partially  correct, or correct with references (perfect). Flesch-Kincaid grade-level unique  words and response lengths were recorded for answers. Proportions of the  responses at differing scores were compared using the chi-square analysis. The  relationship between form and grade level was assessed using the analysis of  variance. Results Across all forms, scoring frequencies were one (1.6%)  incorrect, five (7.8%) partially correct, 55 (85.9%) correct, and three (4.7%)  perfect. Proportions of responses that were at least correct did not differ by  form (p = 0.350), but perfect responses did (p = 0.001). Form 2 answers had a  lower mean grade level (12.80 ± 3.38) than Forms 1 (14.23 ± 2.34), 3 (16.73 ±  2.65), and 4 (14.85 ± 2.76) (p < 0.05). Across all forms, references were  provided in only three (4.7%) answers.

2024,A Longitudinal Investigation of Nasolabial Changes With and Without Revision Surgery in Patients with Non-Syndromic Unilateral Cleft Lip and Palate.,The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association,"OBJECTIVE: To determine a baseline of anticipated change in nasolabial appearance following primary repair of unilateral cleft lip/palate and evaluate the degree  to which revision surgery improves nasolabial appearance. DESIGN: Retrospective  chart review. SETTING: Patients treated at the Lancaster Cleft Palate Clinic  interdisciplinary clinic. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with complete  unilateral cleft lip and palate who underwent primary surgical repair and 19  additional patients who underwent subsequent revision surgery were included.  INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the non-revision group underwent a Tennison-Randall  triangular flap lip repair at 3mo. Patients in the revision group underwent a  modification of the Nakajima straight-line repair after primary Tennison-Randall  triangular flap lip repair at an average age of 141mo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A  modification of the Asher-McDade Aesthetic Index was utilized to evaluate  Nasolabial Frontal (NLF), Nasolabial Profile (NLP), Vermillion Border (VB), and  total change in appearance. Scores for patients in the revision group were  evaluated before and after revision while appearance for patients without  revision was evaluated at 3 distinct ages. Scores were averaged across  time-points and inter-rater reliability was assessed. RESULTS: Nasolabial  appearance in the non-revision sample did not change significantly over time,  except for nasal profile. Scores improved after revision surgery - NLP: 3.48 to  2.97, (p = 0.001); NLF: 3.50 to 2.95 (p = 0.001); and Total Nasolabial Score:  3.29 to 3.01 (p = 0.004), with no significant change in VB. CONCLUSION: Decisions  regarding need for nasolabial revision surgery may be made as early as 5yo with  successful outcomes following secondary surgery improving appearance except for  vermillion border appearance.",0
2024,ChatGPT for Tinnitus Information and Support: Response Accuracy and Retest after Three and Six Months.,Brain sciences,"Testing of ChatGPT has recently been performed over a diverse range of topics. However, most of these assessments have been based on broad domains of knowledge.  Here, we test ChatGPT's knowledge of tinnitus, an important but specialized  aspect of audiology and otolaryngology. Testing involved evaluating ChatGPT's  answers to a defined set of 10 questions on tinnitus. Furthermore, given the  technology is advancing quickly, we re-evaluated the responses to the same 10  questions 3 and 6 months later. The accuracy of the responses was rated by 6  experts (the authors) using a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Most of ChatGPT's  responses were rated as satisfactory or better. However, we did detect a few  instances where the responses were not accurate and might be considered somewhat  misleading. Over the first 3 months, the ratings generally improved, but there  was no more significant improvement at 6 months. In our judgment, ChatGPT  provided unexpectedly good responses, given that the questions were quite  specific. Although no potentially harmful errors were identified, some mistakes  could be seen as somewhat misleading. ChatGPT shows great potential if further  developed by experts in specific areas, but for now, it is not yet ready for  serious application.",1
2024,A reduced proteomic signature in critically ill Covid-19 patients determined with plasma antibody micro-array and machine learning.,Clinical proteomics,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a complex, multi-system disease with varying severity and symptoms. Identifying changes in critically ill COVID-19 patients' proteomes  enables a better understanding of markers associated with susceptibility,  symptoms, and treatment. We performed plasma antibody microarray and machine  learning analyses to identify novel proteins of COVID-19. METHODS: A case-control  study comparing the concentration of 2000 plasma proteins in age- and sex-matched  COVID-19 inpatients, non-COVID-19 sepsis controls, and healthy control subjects.  Machine learning was used to identify a unique proteome signature in COVID-19  patients. Protein expression was correlated with clinically relevant variables  and analyzed for temporal changes over hospitalization days 1, 3, 7, and 10.  Expert-curated protein expression information was analyzed with Natural language  processing (NLP) to determine organ- and cell-specific expression. RESULTS:  Machine learning identified a 28-protein model that accurately differentiated  COVID-19 patients from ICU non-COVID-19 patients (accuracy = 0.89, AUC = 1.00,  F1 = 0.89) and healthy controls (accuracy = 0.89, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 0.88). An  optimal nine-protein model (PF4V1, NUCB1, CrkL, SerpinD1, Fen1, GATA-4, ProSAAS,  PARK7, and NET1) maintained high classification ability. Specific proteins  correlated with hemoglobin, coagulation factors, hypertension, and high-flow  nasal cannula intervention (P < 0.01). Time-course analysis of the 28 leading  proteins demonstrated no significant temporal changes within the COVID-19 cohort.  NLP analysis identified multi-system expression of the key proteins, with the  digestive and nervous systems being the leading systems. CONCLUSIONS: The plasma  proteome of critically ill COVID-19 patients was distinguishable from that of  non-COVID-19 sepsis controls and healthy control subjects. The leading 28  proteins and their subset of 9 proteins yielded accurate classification models  and are expressed in multiple organ systems. The identified COVID-19 proteomic  signature helps elucidate COVID-19 pathophysiology and may guide future COVID-19  treatment development.",0
2024,Knowledge Graphs and Pretrained Language Models Enhanced Representation Learning for Conversational Recommender Systems.,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,"Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) utilize natural language interactions and dialog history to infer user preferences and provide accurate  recommendations. Due to the limited conversation context and background  knowledge, existing CRSs rely on external sources such as knowledge graphs (KGs)  to enrich the context and model entities based on their interrelations. However,  these methods ignore the rich intrinsic information within entities. To address  this, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced entity representation learning (KERL)  framework, which leverages both the KG and a pretrained language model (PLM) to  improve the semantic understanding of entities for CRS. In our KERL framework,  entity textual descriptions are encoded via a PLM, while a KG helps reinforce the  representation of these entities. We also employ positional encoding to  effectively capture the temporal information of entities in a conversation. The  enhanced entity representation is then used to develop a recommender component  that fuses both entity and contextual representations for more informed  recommendations, as well as a dialog component that generates informative  entity-related information in the response text. A high-quality KG with aligned  entity descriptions is constructed to facilitate this study, namely, the Wiki  Movie Knowledge Graph (WikiMKG). The experimental results show that KERL achieves  state-of-the-art results in both recommendation and response generation tasks.  Our code is publicly available at the link: https://github.com/icedpanda/KERL.",0

2025,"Septic Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis: Clinical Characteristics, Management, and Outcomes.",Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,"BACKGROUND: Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare condition traditionally associated with high morbidity and mortality. More recent case  series report more favorable outcomes, including full functional recovery. A  comprehensive assessment of the clinical characteristics and prognostic factors  of visual and survival outcomes in septic CST is warranted to contemporize  current understanding and help guide management. METHODS: A multicentered  retrospective cohort study was conducted at 2 tertiary care centers using an  electronic medical record search of the term, ""thrombosis of cavernous venous  sinus"" between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2021. Inclusion criteria  consisted of active infection and radiographic evidence of associated CST.  Demographic and clinical data extracted included age at presentation, sex,  infection type and extent, and ophthalmic examination findings at  presentation-best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), presence of relative afferent  pupillary defect (RAPD), intraocular pressure (IOP), and extraocular motility  (EOM) limitation. Management data collected consisted of type and length of  antimicrobial therapy, type and length of anticoagulation administration, and  surgical intervention. Primary outcomes assessed were ophthalmic examination  findings at final evaluation and same-hospitalization mortality. RESULTS: A total  of 27 patients with imaging-confirmed septic CST were identified at 2 tertiary  care centers. At presentation, 2 (8.7%) patients had no light perception (NLP)  vision, 8 (29.6%) patients had RAPD, 17 (73.9%) patients had EOM limitation, and  13 (54.2%) had IOP >21 mm Hg. All patients received antimicrobial therapy, with  vancomycin being the most common agent. Fifteen patients (55.6%) received  anticoagulation, and 21 (81.5%) patients underwent surgical intervention.  Same-hospitalization mortality was 3 (11.1%). Among the 21 patients with  ophthalmic data at follow-up, 3 (16.7%) had NLP vision, 5 (23.8%) had a  persistent RAPD, 7 (31.8%) had persistent EOM limitation, and no patients had IOP  elevated above 21 mm Hg. Patients with RAPD at presentation had significantly  worse BCVA at final evaluation (logMAR BCVA 1.43 higher on average, P = 0.01) and  a significantly higher mortality rate (37.5% vs. 0.0%, P < 0.01) than non-RAPD  patients. Demographic features, BCVA at presentation, EOM limitation at  presentation, elevated IOP at presentation, and comorbid orbital cellulitis were  not associated with worse visual or mortality outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Septic CST  may result in permanent ophthalmic functional deficit in almost one-third of  cases and mortality in approximately 11% of patients under contemporary  management. New RAPD at presentation may indicate higher risk of poor visual and  survival outcomes.",0
2024,Full-body pose reconstruction and correction in virtual reality for rehabilitation training.,Frontiers in neuroscience,"Existing statistical data indicates that an increasing number of people now require rehabilitation to restore compromised physical mobility. During the  rehabilitation process, physical therapists evaluate and guide the movements of  patients, aiding them in a more effective recovery of rehabilitation and  preventing secondary injuries. However, the immutability of mobility and the  expensive price of rehabilitation training hinder some patients from timely  access to rehabilitation. Utilizing virtual reality for rehabilitation training  might offer a potential alleviation to these issues. However, prevalent pose  reconstruction algorithms in rehabilitation primarily rely on images, limiting  their applicability to virtual reality. Furthermore, existing pose evaluation and  correction methods in the field of rehabilitation focus on providing clinical  metrics for doctors, and failed to offer patients efficient movement guidance. In  this paper, a virtual reality-based rehabilitation training method is proposed.  The sparse motion signals from virtual reality devices, specifically head-mounted  displays hand controllers, is used to reconstruct full body poses. Subsequently,  the reconstructed poses and the standard poses are fed into a natural language  processing model, which contrasts the difference between the two poses and  provides effective pose correction guidance in the form of natural language.  Quantitative and qualitative results indicate that the proposed method can  accurately reconstruct full body poses from sparse motion signals in real-time.  By referencing standard poses, the model generates professional motion correction  guidance text. This approach facilitates virtual reality-based rehabilitation  training, reducing the cost of rehabilitation training and enhancing the  efficiency of self-rehabilitation training.",0
2024,Portrait of a Surgeon: Artificial Intelligence Reflections.,OTO open,"Text-to-image artificial intelligence (AI) programs are popular public-facing tools that generate novel images based on user prompts. Given that they are  trained from Internet data, they may reflect societal biases, as has been shown  for text-to-text large language model programs. We sought to investigate whether  3 common text-to-image AI systems recapitulated stereotypes held about surgeons  and other health care professionals. All platforms queried were able to reproduce  common aspects of the profession including attire, equipment, and background  settings, but there were differences between programs most notably regarding  visible race and gender diversity. Thus, historical stereotypes of surgeons may  be reinforced by the public's use of text-to-image AI systems, particularly those  without procedures to regulate generated output. As AI systems become more  ubiquitous, understanding the implications of their use in health care and for  health care-adjacent purposes is critical to advocate for and preserve the core  values and goals of our profession.",0
2024,Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis of Otolaryngology Residency Letters of Recommendation.,The Laryngoscope,"INTRODUCTION: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are a highly influential yet subjective and often enigmatic aspect of the residency application process. This  study hypothesizes that LORs do contain valuable insights into applicants and can  be used to predict outcomes. This pilot study utilizes natural language  processing and machine learning (ML) models using LOR text to predict interview  invitations for otolaryngology residency applicants. METHODS: A total of 1642  LORs from the 2022-2023 application cycle were retrospectively retrieved from a  single institution. LORs were preprocessed and vectorized using three different  techniques to represent the text in a way that an ML model can understand written  prose: CountVectorizer (CV), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF),  and Word2Vec (WV). Then, the LORs were trained and tested on five ML models:  Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest  (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). RESULTS: Of the 337 applicants, 67 were  interviewed and 270 were not interviewed. In total, 1642 LORs (26.7% interviewed)  were analyzed. The two best-performing ML models in predicting interview  invitations were the TF-IDF vectorized DT and CV vectorized DT models.  CONCLUSION: This preliminary study revealed that ML models and vectorization  combinations can provide better-than-chance predictions for interview invitations  for otolaryngology residency applicants. The high-performing ML models were able  to classify meaningful information from the LORs to predict applicant interview  invitation. The potential of an automated process to help predict an applicant's  likelihood of obtaining an interview invitation could be a valuable tool for  training programs in the future.

2024,Evaluating the Potential of AI Chatbots in Treatment Decision-making for Acquired Bilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis in Adults.,Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,"OBJECTIVES: The development of artificial intelligence-powered language models, such as Chatbot Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) or Large Language  Model Meta AI (Llama), is emerging in medicine. Patients and practitioners have  full access to chatbots that may provide medical information. The aim of this  study was to explore the performance and accuracy of ChatGPT and Llama in  treatment decision-making for bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP). METHODS:  Data of 20 clinical cases, treated between 2018 and 2023, were retrospectively  collected from four tertiary laryngology centers in Europe. The cases were  defined as the most common or most challenging scenarios regarding BVFP  treatment. The treatment proposals were discussed in their local  multidisciplinary teams (MDT). Each case was presented to ChatGPT-4.0 and Llama  Chat-2.0, and potential treatment strategies were requested. The Artificial  Intelligence Performance Instrument (AIPI) treatment subscore was used to compare  both Chatbots' performances to MDT treatment proposal. RESULTS: Most common  etiology of BVFP was thyroid surgery. A form of partial arytenoidectomy with or  without posterior transverse cordotomy was the MDT proposal for most cases. The  accuracy of both Chatbots was very low regarding their treatment proposals, with  a maximum AIPI treatment score in 5% of the cases. In most cases even harmful  assertions were made, including the suggestion of vocal fold medialisation to  treat patients with stridor and dyspnea. ChatGPT-4.0 performed significantly  better in suggesting the correct treatment as part of the treatment proposal  (50%) compared to Llama Chat-2.0 (15%). CONCLUSION: ChatGPT and Llama are judged  as inaccurate in proposing correct treatment for BVFP. ChatGPT significantly  outperformed Llama. Treatment decision-making for a complex condition such as  BVFP is clearly beyond the Chatbot's knowledge expertise. This study highlights  the complexity and heterogeneity of BVFP treatment, and the need for further  guidelines dedicated to the management of BVFP.",1
2024,Moving Biosurveillance Beyond Coded Data Using AI for Symptom Detection From Physician Notes: Retrospective Cohort Study.,Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: Real-time surveillance of emerging infectious diseases necessitates a dynamically evolving, computable case definition, which frequently incorporates  symptom-related criteria. For symptom detection, both population health  monitoring platforms and research initiatives primarily depend on structured data  extracted from electronic health records. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to  validate and test an artificial intelligence (AI)-based natural language  processing (NLP) pipeline for detecting COVID-19 symptoms from physician notes in  pediatric patients. We specifically study patients presenting to the emergency  department (ED) who can be sentinel cases in an outbreak. METHODS: Subjects in  this retrospective cohort study are patients who are 21 years of age and younger,  who presented to a pediatric ED at a large academic children's hospital between  March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2022. The ED notes for all patients were processed  with an NLP pipeline tuned to detect the mention of 11 COVID-19 symptoms based on  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. For a gold standard, 3  subject matter experts labeled 226 ED notes and had strong agreement  (F(1)-score=0.986; positive predictive value [PPV]=0.972; and sensitivity=1.0).  F(1)-score, PPV, and sensitivity were used to compare the performance of both NLP  and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) coding  to the gold standard chart review. As a formative use case, variations in symptom  patterns were measured across SARS-CoV-2 variant eras. RESULTS: There were 85,678  ED encounters during the study period, including 4% (n=3420) with patients with  COVID-19. NLP was more accurate at identifying encounters with patients that had  any of the COVID-19 symptoms (F(1)-score=0.796) than ICD-10 codes (F(1)-score  =0.451). NLP accuracy was higher for positive symptoms (sensitivity=0.930) than  ICD-10 (sensitivity=0.300). However, ICD-10 accuracy was higher for negative  symptoms (specificity=0.994) than NLP (specificity=0.917). Congestion or runny  nose showed the highest accuracy difference (NLP: F(1)-score=0.828 and ICD-10:  F(1)-score=0.042). For encounters with patients with COVID-19, prevalence  estimates of each NLP symptom differed across variant eras. Patients with  COVID-19 were more likely to have each NLP symptom detected than patients without  this disease. Effect sizes (odds ratios) varied across pandemic eras.  CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the value of AI-based NLP as a highly  effective tool for real-time COVID-19 symptom detection in pediatric patients,  outperforming traditional ICD-10 methods. It also reveals the evolving nature of  symptom prevalence across different virus variants, underscoring the need for  dynamic, technology-driven approaches in infectious disease surveillance.",1

2024,Performance of GPT-4V in Answering the Japanese Otolaryngology Board Certification Examination Questions: Evaluation Study.,JMIR medical education,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence models can learn from medical literature and clinical cases and generate answers that rival human experts. However, challenges  remain in the analysis of complex data containing images and diagrams. OBJECTIVE:  This study aims to assess the answering capabilities and accuracy of ChatGPT-4  Vision (GPT-4V) for a set of 100 questions, including image-based questions, from  the 2023 otolaryngology board certification examination. METHODS: Answers to 100  questions from the 2023 otolaryngology board certification examination, including  image-based questions, were generated using GPT-4V. The accuracy rate was  evaluated using different prompts, and the presence of images, clinical area of  the questions, and variations in the answer content were examined. RESULTS: The  accuracy rate for text-only input was, on average, 24.7% but improved to 47.3%  with the addition of English translation and prompts (P<.001). The average  nonresponse rate for text-only input was 46.3%; this decreased to 2.7% with the  addition of English translation and prompts (P<.001). The accuracy rate was lower  for image-based questions than for text-only questions across all types of input,  with a relatively high nonresponse rate. General questions and questions from the  fields of head and neck allergies and nasal allergies had relatively high  accuracy rates, which increased with the addition of translation and prompts. In  terms of content, questions related to anatomy had the highest accuracy rate. For  all content types, the addition of translation and prompts increased the accuracy  rate. As for the performance based on image-based questions, the average of  correct answer rate with text-only input was 30.4%, and that with text-plus-image  input was 41.3% (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Examination of artificial intelligence's  answering capabilities for the otolaryngology board certification examination  improves our understanding of its potential and limitations in this field.  Although the improvement was noted with the addition of translation and prompts,  the accuracy rate for image-based questions was lower than that for text-based  questions, suggesting room for improvement in GPT-4V at this stage. Furthermore,  text-plus-image input answers a higher rate in image-based questions. Our  findings imply the usefulness and potential of GPT-4V in medicine; however,  future consideration of safe use methods is needed.",1
2024,ChatGPT-4 accuracy for patient education in laryngopharyngeal reflux.,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the  German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Chatbot Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence-powered language model chatbot able to help  otolaryngologists in practice and research. The ability of ChatGPT in generating  patient-centered information related to laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD)  was evaluated. METHODS: Twenty-five questions dedicated to definition, clinical  presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of LPRD were developed from the Dubai  definition and management of LPRD consensus and recent reviews. Questions about  the four aforementioned categories were entered into ChatGPT-4. Four  board-certified laryngologists evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT-4 with a 5-point  Likert scale. Interrater reliability was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean scores (SD)  of ChatGPT-4 answers for definition, clinical presentation, additional  examination, and treatments were 4.13 (0.52), 4.50 (0.72), 3.75 (0.61), and 4.18  (0.47), respectively. Experts reported high interrater reliability for sub-scores  (ICC = 0.973). The lowest performances of ChatGPT-4 were on answers about the  most prevalent LPR signs, the most reliable objective tool for the diagnosis  (hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH monitoring  (HEMII-pH)), and the criteria for the diagnosis of LPR using HEMII-pH.  CONCLUSION: ChatGPT-4 may provide adequate information on the definition of LPR,  differences compared to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), and clinical  presentation. Information provided upon extra-laryngeal manifestations and  HEMII-pH may need further optimization. Regarding the recent trends identifying  increasing patient use of internet sources for self-education, the findings of  the present study may help draw attention to ChatGPT-4's accuracy on the topic of  LPR.",1
2024,The utility and accuracy of ChatGPT in providing post-operative instructions following tonsillectomy: A pilot study.,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of answers generated by ChatGPT, a large language model, to common questions parents have for their children following  tonsillectomy. METHODS: Twenty Otolaryngology residents anonymously submitted  common questions asked by parents of pediatric patients following tonsillectomy.  After identifying the 16 most common questions via consensus-based approach, we  asked ChatGPT to generate responses to these queries. Satisfaction with the  AI-generated answers was rated from 1 (Worst) to 5 (Best) by an expert panel of 3  pediatric Otolaryngologists. RESULTS: The distribution of questions across the  five most common domains, their mean satisfaction scores, and their Krippendorf's  interrater reliability coefficient were: Pain management [6, (3.67), (0.434)],  Complications [4, (3.58), (-0.267)], Diet [3, (4.33), (-0.357)], Physical  Activity [2, (4.33), (-0.318)], and Follow-up [1, (2.67), (-0.250)]. The panel  noted that answers for diet, bleeding complications, and return to school were  thorough. Pain management and follow-up recommendations were inaccurate,  including a recommendation to prescribe codeine to children despite a black-box  warning, and a suggested post-operative follow-up at 1 week, rather than the  customary 2-4 weeks for our panel. CONCLUSION: Although ChatGPT can provide  accurate answers for common patient questions following tonsillectomy, it  sometimes provides eloquently written inaccurate information. This may lead to  patients using AI-generated medical advice contrary to physician advice. The  inaccuracy in pain management answers likely reflects regional practice  variability. If trained appropriately, ChatGPT could be an excellent resource for  Otolaryngologists and patients to answer questions in the postoperative period.  Future research should investigate if Otolaryngologist-trained models can  increase the accuracy of responses.",1

2024,ChatGPT as an information tool in rhinology. Can we trust each other today?,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the  German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"PURPOSE: ChatGPT (Chat-Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has proven to be a powerful information tool on various topics, including healthcare. This system is  based on information obtained on the Internet, but this information is not always  reliable. Currently, few studies analyze the validity of these responses in  rhinology. Our work aims to assess the quality and reliability of the information  provided by AI regarding the main rhinological pathologies. METHODS: We asked to  the default ChatGPT version (GPT-3.5) 65 questions about the most prevalent  pathologies in rhinology. The focus was learning about the causes, risk factors,  treatments, prognosis, and outcomes. We use the Discern questionnaire and a  hexagonal radar schema to evaluate the quality of the information. We use  Fleiss's kappa statistical analysis to determine the consistency of agreement  between different observers. RESULTS: The overall evaluation of the Discern  questionnaire resulted in a score of 4.05 (± 0.6). The results in the Reliability  section are worse, with an average score of 3.18. (± 1.77). This score is  affected by the responses to questions about the source of the information  provided. The average score for the Quality section was 3.59 (± 1.18).

2024,"A quantitative analysis of Twitter (""X"") trends in the discussion of rhinoplasty.",Laryngoscope investigative otolaryngology,"INTRODUCTION: Rhinoplasty is one of the most common cosmetic surgical procedures performed globally. Twitter, also known as ""X,"" is used by both patients and  physicians and has been studied as a useful tool for analyzing trends in  healthcare. The public social media discourse of rhinoplasty has not been  previously reported in the field of otolaryngology. The goal of this study was to  characterize the most common user type, sentiment, and temporal trends in the  discussion of rhinoplasty on Twitter to guide facial plastic surgeons in their  clinical and social media practices. METHODS: A total of 1,427,015 tweets  published from 2015 to 2020 containing the keywords ""rhinoplasty"" or ""nose job""  were extracted using Twitter Academic API. Tweets were standardized and filtered  for spam and duplication. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and data  visualization techniques were applied to characterize tweets. RESULTS:  Significantly more ""nose job"" tweets (80.8%) were published compared with  ""rhinoplasty"" (19.2%). Annual tweet frequency increased over the 5 years, with  ""rhinoplasty"" tweets peaking in January and ""nose job"" tweets peaking in the  summer and winter months. Most ""rhinoplasty"" tweets were linked to a surgeon or  medical practice source, while most ""nose job"" tweets were from isolated  laypersons. While discussion was positive in sentiment overall (M = +0.08), ""nose  job"" tweets had lower average sentiment scores (P < .001) and over twice the  proportion of negative tweets. The top 20 most prolific accounts contributed to  14,758 (10.6%) of total ""rhinoplasty"" tweets. Exactly 90% (18/20) of those  accounts linked to non-academic surgeons compared with 10% (2/20) linked to  academic surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Rhinoplasty-related posts on Twitter were  cumulatively positive in sentiment and tweet volume is steadily increasing over  time, especially during popular holiday months.

2024,Performance of Generative Pretrained Transformer on the National Medical Licensing Examination in Japan.,PLOS digital health,"The remarkable performance of ChatGPT, launched in November 2022, has significantly impacted the field of natural language processing, inspiring the  application of large language models as supportive tools in clinical practice and  research worldwide. Although GPT-3.5 recently scored high on the United States  Medical Licensing Examination, its performance on medical licensing examinations  of other nations, especially non-English speaking nations, has not been  sufficiently evaluated. This study assessed GPT's performance on the National  Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE) in Japan and compared it with the actual  minimal passing rate for this exam. In particular, the performances of both the  GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models were considered for the comparative analysis. We  initially used the GPT models and several prompts for 290 questions without image  data from the 116th NMLE (held in February 2022 in Japan) to maximize the  performance for delivering correct answers and explanations of the questions.  Thereafter, we tested the performance of the best GPT model (GPT-4) with  optimized prompts on a dataset of 262 questions without images from the latest  117th NMLE (held in February 2023). The best model with the optimized prompts  scored 82.7% for the essential questions and 77.2% for the basic and clinical  questions, both of which sufficed the minimum passing scoring rates of 80.0% and  74.6%, respectively. After an exploratory analysis of 56 incorrect answers from  the model, we identified the three major factors contributing to the generation  of the incorrect answers-insufficient medical knowledge, information on  Japan-specific medical system and guidelines, and mathematical errors. In  conclusion, GPT-4 with our optimized prompts achieved a minimum passing scoring  rate in the latest 117th NMLE in Japan. Beyond its original design of answering  examination questions for humans, these artificial intelligence (AI) models can  serve as one of the best ""sidekicks"" for solving problems and addressing the  unmet needs in the medical and healthcare fields.",0

2024,Reliability of large language models in managing odontogenic sinusitis clinical scenarios: a preliminary multidisciplinary evaluation.,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the  German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the utility of large language model (LLM) artificial intelligence tools, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT)  versions 3.5 and 4, in managing complex otolaryngological clinical scenarios,  specifically for the multidisciplinary management of odontogenic sinusitis (ODS).  METHODS: A prospective, structured multidisciplinary specialist evaluation was  conducted using five ad hoc designed ODS-related clinical scenarios. LLM  responses to these scenarios were critically reviewed by a multidisciplinary  panel of eight specialist evaluators (2 ODS experts, 2 rhinologists, 2 general  otolaryngologists, and 2 maxillofacial surgeons). Based on the level of  disagreement from panel members, a Total Disagreement Score (TDS) was calculated  for each LLM response, and TDS comparisons were made between ChatGPT3.5 and  ChatGPT4, as well as between different evaluators. RESULTS: While disagreement to  some degree was demonstrated in 73/80 evaluator reviews of LLMs' responses, TDSs  were significantly lower for ChatGPT4 compared to ChatGPT3.5. Highest TDSs were  found in the case of complicated ODS with orbital abscess, presumably due to  increased case complexity with dental, rhinologic, and orbital factors affecting  diagnostic and therapeutic options. There were no statistically significant  differences in TDSs between evaluators' specialties, though ODS experts and  maxillofacial surgeons tended to assign higher TDSs. CONCLUSIONS: LLMs like  ChatGPT, especially newer versions, showed potential for complimenting  evidence-based clinical decision-making, but substantial disagreement was still  demonstrated between LLMs and clinical specialists across most case examples,  suggesting they are not yet optimal in aiding clinical management decisions.  Future studies will be important to analyze LLMs' performance as they evolve over  time.",1

2023,Stratified Evaluation of GPT's Question Answering in Surgery Reveals Artificial Intelligence (AI) Knowledge Gaps.,Cureus,"Large language models (LLMs) have broad potential applications in medicine, such as aiding with education, providing reassurance to patients, and supporting  clinical decision-making. However, there is a notable gap in understanding their  applicability and performance in the surgical domain and how their performance  varies across specialties. This paper aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs in  answering surgical questions relevant to clinical practice and to assess how this  performance varies across different surgical specialties. We used the MedMCQA  dataset, a large-scale multi-choice question-answer (MCQA) dataset consisting of  clinical questions across all areas of medicine. We extracted the relevant 23,035  surgical questions and submitted them to the popular LLMs Generative Pre-trained  Transformers (GPT)-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI OpCo, LLC, San Francisco, CA).  Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a large language model that can generate  human-like text by predicting subsequent words in a sentence based on the context  of the words that come before it. It is pre-trained on a diverse range of texts  and can perform a variety of tasks, such as answering questions, without needing  task-specific training. The question-answering accuracy of GPT was calculated and  compared between the two models and across surgical specialties. Both GPT-3.5 and  GPT-4 achieved accuracies of 53.3% and 64.4%, respectively, on surgical  questions, showing a statistically significant difference in performance. When  compared to their performance on the full MedMCQA dataset, the two models  performed differently: GPT-4 performed worse on surgical questions than on the  dataset as a whole, while GPT-3.5 showed the opposite pattern. Significant  variations in accuracy were also observed across different surgical specialties,  with strong performances in anatomy, vascular, and paediatric surgery and worse  performances in orthopaedics, ENT, and neurosurgery. Large language models  exhibit promising capabilities in addressing surgical questions, although the  variability in their performance between specialties cannot be ignored. The lower  performance of the latest GPT-4 model on surgical questions relative to questions  across all medicine highlights the need for targeted improvements and continuous  updates to ensure relevance and accuracy in surgical applications. Further  research and continuous monitoring of LLM performance in surgical domains are  crucial to fully harnessing their potential and mitigating the risks of  misinformation.",0

2023,Genetic Discovery Enabled by A Large Language Model.,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in many areas of medicine, and recently large language models (LLMs) have shown potential utility for clinical  applications. However, since we do not know if the use of LLMs can accelerate the  pace of genetic discovery, we used data generated from mouse genetic models to  investigate this possibility. We examined whether a recently developed  specialized LLM (Med-PaLM 2) could analyze sets of candidate genes generated from  analysis of murine models of biomedical traits. In response to free-text input,  Med-PaLM 2 correctly identified the murine genes that contained experimentally  verified causative genetic factors for six biomedical traits, which included  susceptibility to diabetes and cataracts. Med-PaLM 2 was also able to analyze a  list of genes with high impact alleles, which were identified by comparative  analysis of murine genomic sequence data, and it identified a causative murine  genetic factor for spontaneous hearing loss. Based upon this Med-PaLM 2 finding,  a novel bigenic model for susceptibility to spontaneous hearing loss was  developed. These results demonstrate Med-PaLM 2 can analyze gene-phenotype  relationships and generate novel hypotheses, which can facilitate genetic  discovery.",1
2024,Chat GPT for the management of obstructive sleep apnea: do we have a polar star?,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the  German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,"PURPOSE: This study explores the potential of the Chat-Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (Chat-GPT), a Large Language Model (LLM), in assisting healthcare  professionals in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It aims to  assess the agreement between Chat-GPT's responses and those of expert  otolaryngologists, shedding light on the role of AI-generated content in medical  decision-making. METHODS: A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted,  involving 350 otolaryngologists from 25 countries who responded to a specialized  OSA survey. Chat-GPT was tasked with providing answers to the same survey  questions. Responses were assessed by both super-experts and statistically  analyzed for agreement. RESULTS: The study revealed that Chat-GPT and expert  responses shared a common answer in over 75% of cases for individual questions.  However, the overall consensus was achieved in only four questions. Super-expert  assessments showed a moderate agreement level, with Chat-GPT scoring slightly  lower than experts. Statistically, Chat-GPT's responses differed significantly  from experts' opinions (p = 0.0009). Sub-analysis revealed areas of improvement  for Chat-GPT, particularly in questions where super-experts rated its responses  lower than expert consensus. CONCLUSIONS: Chat-GPT demonstrates potential as a  valuable resource for OSA diagnosis, especially where access to specialists is  limited. The study emphasizes the importance of AI-human collaboration, with  Chat-GPT serving as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for medical  professionals. This research contributes to the discourse in otolaryngology and  encourages further exploration of AI-driven healthcare applications. While  Chat-GPT exhibits a commendable level of consensus with expert responses, ongoing  refinements in AI-based healthcare tools hold significant promise for the future  of medicine, addressing the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of OSA and  improving patient outcomes.",1

2023,Leading and following: Noise differently affects semantic and acoustic processing during naturalistic speech comprehension.,NeuroImage,"Despite the distortion of speech signals caused by unavoidable noise in daily life, our ability to comprehend speech in noisy environments is relatively  stable. However, the neural mechanisms underlying reliable speech-in-noise  comprehension remain to be elucidated. The present study investigated the neural  tracking of acoustic and semantic speech information during noisy naturalistic  speech comprehension. Participants listened to narrative audio recordings mixed  with spectrally matched stationary noise at three signal-to-ratio (SNR) levels  (no noise, 3 dB, -3 dB), and 60-channel electroencephalography (EEG) signals were  recorded. A temporal response function (TRF) method was employed to derive  event-related-like responses to the continuous speech stream at both the acoustic  and the semantic levels. Whereas the amplitude envelope of the naturalistic  speech was taken as the acoustic feature, word entropy and word surprisal were  extracted via the natural language processing method as two semantic features.  Theta-band frontocentral TRF responses to the acoustic feature were observed at  around 400 ms following speech fluctuation onset over all three SNR levels, and  the response latencies were more delayed with increasing noise. Delta-band  frontal TRF responses to the semantic feature of word entropy were observed at  around 200 to 600 ms leading to speech fluctuation onset over all three SNR  levels. The response latencies became more leading with increasing noise and  decreasing speech comprehension and intelligibility. While the following  responses to speech acoustics were consistent with previous studies, our study  revealed the robustness of leading responses to speech semantics, which suggests  a possible predictive mechanism at the semantic level for maintaining reliable  speech comprehension in noisy environments.",0
2023,"A multimodal dialog approach to mental state characterization in clinically depressed, anxious, and suicidal populations.",Frontiers in psychology,"BACKGROUND: The rise of depression, anxiety, and suicide rates has led to increased demand for telemedicine-based mental health screening and remote  patient monitoring (RPM) solutions to alleviate the burden on, and enhance the  efficiency of, mental health practitioners. Multimodal dialog systems (MDS) that  conduct on-demand, structured interviews offer a scalable and cost-effective  solution to address this need. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of  a cloud based MDS agent, Tina, for mental state characterization in participants  with depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. METHOD: Sixty-eight participants were  recruited through an online health registry and completed 73 sessions, with 15  (20.6%), 21 (28.8%), and 26 (35.6%) sessions screening positive for depression,  anxiety, and suicide risk, respectively using conventional screening instruments.  Participants then interacted with Tina as they completed a structured interview  designed to elicit calibrated, open-ended responses regarding the participants'  feelings and emotional state. Simultaneously, the platform streamed their speech  and video recordings in real-time to a HIPAA-compliant cloud server, to compute  speech, language, and facial movement-based biomarkers. After their sessions,  participants completed user experience surveys. Machine learning models were  developed using extracted features and evaluated with the area under the receiver  operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: For both depression and suicide  risk, affected individuals tended to have a higher percent pause time, while  those positive for anxiety showed reduced lip movement relative to healthy  controls. In terms of single-modality classification models, speech features  performed best for depression (AUC = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.51-0.78), facial features  for anxiety (AUC = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.43-0.71), and text features for suicide risk  (AUC = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52-0.78). Best overall performance was achieved by  decision fusion of all models in identifying suicide risk (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI =  0.65-0.87). Participants reported the experience comfortable and shared their  feelings. CONCLUSION: MDS is a feasible, useful, effective, and interpretable  solution for RPM in real-world clinical depression, anxiety, and suicidal  populations. Facial information is more informative for anxiety classification,  while speech and language are more discriminative of depression and suicidality  markers. In general, combining speech, language, and facial information improved  model performance on all classification tasks.",0

2023,Diagnostic and Management Applications of ChatGPT in Structured Otolaryngology Clinical Scenarios.,OTO open,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical applications and limitations of chat generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) in otolaryngology. STUDY DESIGN:  Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: ChatGPT 4.0  was queried for diagnoses and management plans for 20 physician-written clinical  vignettes in otolaryngology. Attending physicians were then asked to rate the  difficulty of the clinical vignettes and agreement with the differential  diagnoses and management plans of ChatGPT responses on a 5-point Likert scale.  Summary statistics were calculated. Univariate ordinal regression was then  performed between vignette difficulty and quality of the diagnoses and management  plans. RESULTS: Eleven attending physicians completed the survey (61% response  rate). Overall, vignettes were rated as very easy to neutral difficulty (range of  median score: 1.00-4.00; overall median 2.00). There was a high agreement with  the differential diagnosis provided by ChatGPT (range of median score: 3.00-5.00;  overall median: 5.00). There was also high agreement with treatment plans (range  of median score: 3.00-5.00; overall median: 5.00). There was no association  between vignette difficulty and agreement with differential diagnosis or  treatment. Lower diagnosis scores had greater odds of having lower treatment  scores. CONCLUSION: Generative artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT are  being rapidly adopted in medicine. Performance with curated, easy-to-moderate  difficulty otolaryngology scenarios indicate high agreement with physicians for  diagnosis and management. However, a decreased quality in diagnosis is associated  with decreased quality in management. Further research is necessary on ChatGPT's  ability to handle unstructured clinical information.",1
2023,Harnessing the power of electronic health records and open natural language data mining to capture meaningful patient experience during routine clinical care.,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,"INTRODUCTION: Electronic health records (EHR) are a rich data source for both quality improvement and clinical research. Natural language processing can be  harnessed to extract data from these previously difficult to access sources.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to create and apply a natural language  search query to extract EHR data to ask and answer quality improvement questions  at a pediatric aerodigestive center. METHODS: We developed a combined natural  language search query to extract clinically meaningful data along with  International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD10) and Current  Procedural Terminology (CPT) code data. This search query was applied to a single  pediatric aerodigestive center to answer key clinical questions asked by  families. Data were extracted from EHR data from first clinic visit, operative  note, microbiology lab report, and pathology report for all new patients from  2020 to 2021. Included as three queries were: 1) if I bring my child to a  pediatric aerodigestive center, how often will my child obtain a medical  diagnosis without needing an intervention? 2) if my child has a diagnostic  procedure, how often will a diagnosis be made? 3) if a diagnosis is made, can it  be addressed during that endoscopic intervention? RESULTS: For the 711 new  patients coming to the pediatric aerodigestive center from 2020 to 2021, only  26-32% required an interventional triple endoscopy (rigid/flexible bronchoscopy  with esophagoduodenoscopy). Of these triple endoscopies, 75.7% resulted in a  positive finding that enabled optimization of that child's care. Of the 221  patients who underwent diagnostic triple endoscopies, 40.7% underwent  intervention at the same time for laryngeal cleft (injection or suture, dependent  upon age). CONCLUSION: Here we created an effective model of open language search  query to extract meaningful metrics of patient experience from EHR data. This  model easily allows the EHR to be harnessed to create retrospective and  prospective databases that can be readily queried to answer clinical questions  important to patients. Such databases are widely applicable not just to pediatric  aerodigestive centers but to any clinical care setting using an EHR.",1

2023,Advances in Clinical Voice Quality Analysis with VOXplot.,Journal of clinical medicine,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of voice quality can be evaluated perceptually with standard clinical practice, also including acoustic evaluation of digital voice  recordings to validate and further interpret perceptual judgments. The goal of  the present study was to determine the strongest acoustic voice quality  parameters for perceived hoarseness and breathiness when analyzing the sustained  vowel [a:] using a new clinical acoustic tool, the VOXplot software. METHODS: A  total of 218 voice samples of individuals with and without voice disorders were  applied to perceptual and acoustic analyses. Overall, 13 single acoustic  parameters were included to determine validity aspects in relation to perceptions  of hoarseness and breathiness. RESULTS: Four single acoustic measures could be  clearly associated with perceptions of hoarseness or breathiness. For hoarseness,  the harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) and pitch perturbation quotient with a  smoothing factor of five periods (PPQ5), and, for breathiness, the smoothed  cepstral peak prominence (CPPS) and the glottal-to-noise excitation ratio (GNE)  were shown to be highly valid, with a significant difference being demonstrated  for each of the other perceptual voice quality aspects. CONCLUSIONS: Two acoustic  measures, the HNR and the PPQ5, were both strongly associated with perceptions of  hoarseness and were able to discriminate hoarseness from breathiness with good  confidence. Two other acoustic measures, the CPPS and the GNE, were both strongly  associated with perceptions of breathiness and were able to discriminate  breathiness from hoarseness with good confidence.",0

2023,Dronedarone Versus Sotalol in Antiarrhythmic Drug-Naive Veterans With Atrial Fibrillation.,Circulation. Arrhythmia and electrophysiology,"BACKGROUND: Sotalol and dronedarone are both used for maintenance of sinus rhythm for patients with atrial fibrillation. However, while sotalol requires initial  monitoring for QT prolongation and proarrhythmia, dronedarone does not. These  treatments can be used in comparable patients, but their safety and effectiveness  have not been compared head to head. Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated the  effectiveness and safety using data from a large health care system. METHODS:  Using Veterans Health Administration data, we identified 11 296 antiarrhythmic  drug-naive patients with atrial fibrillation prescribed dronedarone or sotalol in  2012 or later. We excluded patients with prior conduction disease, pacemakers or  implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ventricular arrhythmia, cancer, renal  failure, liver disease, or heart failure. We used natural language processing to  identify and compare baseline left ventricular ejection fraction between  treatment arms. We used 1:1 propensity score matching, based on patient  demographics, comorbidities, and medications, and Cox regression to compare  strategies. To evaluate residual confounding, we performed falsification analysis  with nonplausible outcomes. RESULTS: The matched cohort comprised 6212 patients  (3106 dronedarone and 3106 sotalol; mean [±SD] age, 71±10 years; 2.5% female;  mean [±SD] CHA(2)DS(2)-VASC, 2±1.3). The mean (±SD) left ventricular ejection  fraction was 55±11 and 58±10 for dronedarone and sotalol users, correspondingly.  Dronedarone, compared with sotalol, did not demonstrate a significant association  with risk of cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% CI,  0.88-1.21]) or all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.68-1.16]).  However, dronedarone was associated with significantly lower risk of ventricular  proarrhythmic events (hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.38-0.74]) and symptomatic  bradycardia (hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.37-0.87]). The primary findings were  stable across sensitivity analyses. Falsification analyses were not significant.  CONCLUSIONS: Dronedarone, compared with sotalol, was associated with a lower risk  of ventricular proarrhythmic events and conduction disorders while having no  difference in risk of incident cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality.  These observational data provide the basis for prospective efficacy and safety  trials.",0

2023,Performance of the Large Language Model ChatGPT on the National Nurse Examinations in Japan: Evaluation Study.,JMIR nursing,"BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a large language model, has shown good performance on physician certification examinations and medical consultations. However, its  performance has not been examined in languages other than English or on nursing  examinations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on the  Japanese National Nurse Examinations. METHODS: We evaluated the percentages of  correct answers provided by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) for all questions on the Japanese  National Nurse Examinations from 2019 to 2023, excluding inappropriate questions  and those containing images. Inappropriate questions were pointed out by a  third-party organization and announced by the government to be excluded from  scoring. Specifically, these include ""questions with inappropriate question  difficulty"" and ""questions with errors in the questions or choices."" These  examinations consist of 240 questions each year, divided into basic knowledge  questions that test the basic issues of particular importance to nurses and  general questions that test a wide range of specialized knowledge. Furthermore,  the questions had 2 types of formats: simple-choice and situation-setup  questions. Simple-choice questions are primarily knowledge-based and  multiple-choice, whereas situation-setup questions entail the candidate reading a  patient's and family situation's description, and selecting the nurse's action or  patient's response. Hence, the questions were standardized using 2 types of  prompts before requesting answers from ChatGPT. Chi-square tests were conducted  to compare the percentage of correct answers for each year's examination format  and specialty area related to the question. In addition, a Cochran-Armitage trend  test was performed with the percentage of correct answers from 2019 to 2023.  RESULTS: The 5-year average percentage of correct answers for ChatGPT was 75.1%  (SD 3%) for basic knowledge questions and 64.5% (SD 5%) for general questions.  The highest percentage of correct answers on the 2019 examination was 80% for  basic knowledge questions and 71.2% for general questions. ChatGPT met the  passing criteria for the 2019 Japanese National Nurse Examination and was close  to passing the 2020-2023 examinations, with only a few more correct answers  required to pass. ChatGPT had a lower percentage of correct answers in some  areas, such as pharmacology, social welfare, related law and regulations,  endocrinology/metabolism, and dermatology, and a higher percentage of correct  answers in the areas of nutrition, pathology, hematology, ophthalmology,  otolaryngology, dentistry and dental surgery, and nursing integration and  practice. CONCLUSIONS: ChatGPT only passed the 2019 Japanese National Nursing  Examination during the most recent 5 years. Although it did not pass the  examinations from other years, it performed very close to the passing level, even  in those containing questions related to psychology, communication, and nursing.",0
2023,Cardiomuscular Biomarkers in the Diagnosis and Prognostication of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Myocarditis.,Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are approved for multiple cancers but can result in ICI-associated myocarditis, an infrequent but life-threatening  condition. Elevations in cardiac biomarkers, specifically troponin-I (cTnI),  troponin-T (cTnT), and creatine kinase (CK), are used for diagnosis. However, the  association between temporal elevations of these biomarkers with disease  trajectory and outcomes has not been established. METHODS: We analyzed the  diagnostic accuracy and prognostic performances of cTnI, cTnT, and CK in patients  with ICI myocarditis (n=60) through 1-year follow-up in 2 cardio-oncology units  (APHP Sorbonne, Paris, France and Heidelberg, Germany). A total of 1751 (1 cTnT  assay type), 920 (4 cTnI assay types), and 1191 CK sampling time points were  available. Major adverse cardiomyotoxic events (MACE) were defined as heart  failure, ventricular arrhythmia, atrioventricular or sinus block requiring  pacemaker, respiratory muscle failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and  sudden cardiac death. Diagnostic performance of cTnI and cTnT was also assessed  in an international ICI myocarditis registry. RESULTS: Within 72 hours of  admission, cTnT, cTnI, and CK were increased compared with upper reference limits  (URLs) in 56 of 57 (98%), 37 of 42 ([88%] P=0.03 versus cTnT), and 43 of 57  ([75%] P<0.001 versus cTnT), respectively. This increased rate of positivity for  cTnT (93%) versus cTnI ([64%] P<0.001) on admission was confirmed in 87  independent cases from an international registry. In the Franco-German cohort, 24  of 60 (40%) patients developed ≥1 MACE (total, 52; median time to first MACE, 5  [interquartile range, 2-16] days). The highest value of cTnT:URL within the first  72 hours of admission performed best in terms of association with MACE within 90  days (area under the curve, 0.84) than CK:URL (area under the curve, 0.70). A  cTnT:URL ≥32 within 72 hours of admission was the best cut-off associated with  MACE within 90 days (hazard ratio, 11.1 [95% CI, 3.2-38.0]; P<0.001), after  adjustment for age and sex. cTnT was increased in all patients within 72 hours of  the first MACE (23 of 23 [100%]), whereas cTnI and CK values were less than the  URL in 2 of 19 (11%) and 6 of 22 (27%) of patients (P<0.001), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: cTnT is associated with MACE and is sensitive for diagnosis and  surveillance in patients with ICI myocarditis. A cTnT:URL ratio <32 within 72  hours of diagnosis is associated with a subgroup at low risk for MACE. Potential  differences in diagnostic and prognostic performances between cTnT and cTnI as a  function of the assays used deserve further evaluation in ICI myocarditis.",0
2023,Automated Identification of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: Algorithm Development and Evaluation  Study.,JMIR AI,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is an acquired inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of asthma, chronic  rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and respiratory hypersensitivity reactions  on ingestion of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Despite AERD having a classic constellation of symptoms, the diagnosis is often  overlooked, with an average of greater than 10 years between the onset of  symptoms and diagnosis of AERD. Without a diagnosis, individuals will lack  opportunities to receive effective treatments, such as aspirin desensitization or  biologic medications. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop a combined algorithm that  integrates both natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML)  techniques to identify patients with AERD from an electronic health record (EHR).  METHODS: A rule-based decision tree algorithm incorporating NLP-based features  was developed using clinical documents from the EHR at Mayo Clinic. From clinical  notes, using NLP techniques, 7 features were extracted that included the  following: AERD, asthma, NSAID allergy, nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, elevated  urine leukotriene E4 level, and documented no-NSAID allergy. MedTagger was used  to extract these 7 features from the unstructured clinical text given a set of  keywords and patterns based on the chart review of 2 allergy and immunology  experts for AERD. The status of each extracted feature was quantified by  assigning the frequency of its occurrence in clinical documents per subject. We  optimized the decision tree classifier's hyperparameters cutoff threshold on the  training set to determine the representative feature combination to discriminate  AERD. We then evaluated the resulting model on the test set. RESULTS: The AERD  algorithm, which combines NLP and ML techniques, achieved an area under the  receiver operating characteristic curve score, sensitivity, and specificity of  0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.94), 80.00 (95% CI 70.82-87.33), and 88.00 (95% CI  79.98-93.64) for the test set, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a  promising AERD algorithm that needs further refinement to improve AERD diagnosis.  Continued development of NLP and ML technologies has the potential to reduce  diagnostic delays for AERD and improve the health of our patients.",1
2023,GPT-4 accuracy and completeness against International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis.,International forum of allergy & rhinology,GPT-4 is an AI language model that can answer basic questions about rhinologic disease.

2023,Bilateral Vocal Fold Paralysis in a Patient With Neurosarcoidosis: A ChatGPT-Driven Case Report Describing an Unusual Presentation.,Cureus,"This ChatGPT-driven case report describes a unique presentation of neurosarcoidosis. The patient, a 58-year-old female, initially presented with  hoarseness and was found to have bilateral jugular foramen tumors and thoracic  lymphadenopathy. Imaging revealed significant enlargement and thickening of the  vagus nerve and a separate mass of the cervical sympathetic trunk. The patient  was referred for an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the abnormal neck masses to  establish a pathologic diagnosis. The patient subsequently underwent neck  dissection for exposure of the vagus nerve and isolation of the great vessels in  preparation for a transmastoid approach to the skull base. The presence of  multifocal tumors prompted the need for a biopsy, which ultimately revealed  sarcoid granulomas in the nervous system. The patient was diagnosed with  neurosarcoidosis. This case highlights the potential for sarcoidosis to affect  the nervous system, with multiple cranial nerve involvement, seizures, and  cognitive impairment. It also emphasizes the need for a combination of clinical,  radiological, and pathological findings for an accurate diagnosis of  neurosarcoidosis. Additionally, this case highlights the utility of natural  language processing (NLP), as the entire case report was written using ChatGPT.  This report serves as a comparison of the quality of case reports generated by  humans versus NLP algorithms. The original case report can be found in the  references.",1
2023,Enhancing Expert Panel Discussions in Pediatric Palliative Care: Innovative Scenario Development and Summarization With ChatGPT-4.,Cureus,"This study presents a novel approach to enhance expert panel discussions in a medical conference through the use of ChatGPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained  Transformer version 4), a recently launched powerful artificial intelligence (AI)  language model. We report on ChatGPT-4's ability to optimize and summarize the  medical conference panel recommendations of the first Pan-Arab Pediatric  Palliative Critical Care Hybrid Conference, held in Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia. ChatGPT-4 was incorporated into the discussions in two sequential phases:  first, scenarios were optimized by the AI model to stimulate in-depth  conversations; second, the model identified, summarized, and contrasted key  themes from the panel and audience discussions. The results suggest that  ChatGPT-4 effectively facilitated complex do-not-resuscitate (DNR) conflict  resolution by summarizing key themes such as effective communication,  collaboration, patient and family-centered care, trust, and ethical  considerations. The inclusion of ChatGPT-4 in pediatric palliative care panel  discussions demonstrated potential benefits for enhancing critical thinking among  medical professionals. Further research is warranted to validate and broaden  these insights across various settings and cultures.",0

This  hybrid narrative review, conducted collaboratively by human authors and ChatGPT,  aims to summarize and synthesize the current knowledge of ChatGPT in the indexed  medical literature during its initial four months. A search strategy was employed  in PubMed and EuropePMC databases, yielding 65 and 110 papers, respectively.  These papers focused on ChatGPT's impact on medical education, scientific  research, medical writing, ethical considerations, diagnostic decision-making,  automation potential, and criticisms. The findings indicate a growing body of  literature on ChatGPT's applications and implications in healthcare, highlighting  the need for further research to assess its effectiveness and ethical concerns.",0
2023,A natural language processing approach to uncover patterns among online ratings of otolaryngologists.,The Journal of laryngology and otology,"BACKGROUND: Patients increasingly use physician rating websites to evaluate and choose potential healthcare providers. A sentiment analysis and machine learning  approach can uniquely analyse written prose to quantitatively describe patients'  perspectives from interactions with their physicians. METHODS: Online written  reviews and star scores were analysed from Healthgrades.com using a natural  language processing sentiment analysis package. Demographics of otolaryngologists  were compared and a multivariable regression for individual words was performed.  RESULTS: This study analysed 18 546 online reviews of 1240 otolaryngologists  across the USA. Younger otolaryngologists (aged less than 40 years) had higher  sentiment and star scores compared with older otolaryngologists (p < 0.001). Male  otolaryngologists had higher sentiment and star scores compared with female  otolaryngologists (p < 0.001). 'Confident', 'kind', 'recommend' and 'comfortable'  were words associated with positive reviews (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Positive  bedside manner was strongly reflected in better reviews, and younger age and male  gender of the otolaryngologist were associated with better sentiment and star  scores.",1
2023,Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Real-World Data Analysis.,Diabetes & metabolism journal,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the adverse events (AEs) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination in patients with type 2 diabetes  mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This study used vaccine AE reporting system data to  investigate severe AEs among vaccinated patients with T2DM. A natural language  processing algorithm was applied to identify people with and without diabetes.  After 1:3 matching, we collected data for 6,829 patients with T2DM and 20,487  healthy controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the  odds ratio for severe AEs. RESULTS: After COVID-19 vaccination, patients with  T2DM were more likely to experience eight severe AEs than controls: cerebral  venous sinus thrombosis, encephalitis myelitis encephalomyelitis, Bell's palsy,  lymphadenopathy, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), thrombocytopenia  (TP), and pulmonary embolism (PE). Moreover, patients with T2DM vaccinated with  BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 were more vulnerable to DVT and TP than those vaccinated  with JNJ-78436735. Among patients with T2DM administered mRNA vaccines, mRNA-1273  was safer than BNT162b2 in terms of the risk of DVT and PE. CONCLUSION: Careful  monitoring of severe AEs in patients with T2DM may be necessary, especially for  those related to thrombotic events and neurological dysfunctions after COVID-19  vaccination.",0
2023,Bilateral Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Due to Bilateral Anterior-Drainage Dural Carotid-Cavernous Fistulas: A Case Report.,International medical case reports journal,"PURPOSE: To report a case of bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) due to bilateral anterior-drainage dural carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs). CASE  DESCRIPTION: We report on a 62-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled  hypertension who presented with sudden bilateral visual loss and headache for 5  days. She denied a history of head trauma. On examination, her visual acuities  were no light perception (NLP) with fixed pupils in both eyes. The ocular  motility of both eyes was limited in all directions. Both eyelids were difficult  to open. Anterior segment examination revealed bilateral chemosis and episcleral  corkscrew vessels. Intraocular pressures were 45 and 48 mmHg in her right and  left eyes, respectively. Gonioscopy revealed blood in Schlemm's canal at the  nasal angle of the right eye. Fundus examination showed slightly dilated and  tortuous retinal veins with normal-appearing optic discs in both eyes. The  cup-to-disc ratios were 0.3 bilaterally. Other neurological examinations were  unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated dilation of the bilateral  superior ophthalmic veins (SOVs), and marked orbital and periorbital congestion  bilaterally. However, there was no compression or stretching of the bilateral  optic nerves. Diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging, with  corresponding reduced apparent diffusion coefficient, in the entire bilateral  orbital segment of the optic nerves was revealed, consistent with bilateral PION.  Magnetic resonance angiography revealed arterialization of the bilateral  cavernous sinuses and SOVs. Cerebral angiography confirmed the diagnosis of  bilateral anterior-drainage dural CCFs. Treatment with transvenous coil  embolization was successful. Three months after embolization, ophthalmic  examination demonstrated progressive improvement of aforementioned ophthalmic  signs; however, her visual acuities remained NLP in both eyes. CONCLUSION: To our  knowledge, this is the first reported case of bilateral PION due to bilateral  anterior-drainage dural CCFs. In spite of its rarity, PION should be considered  as a severe, irreversible ophthalmic complication of anterior-drainage dural CCF.",0
2023,Exploring patient experiences and concerns in the online Cochlear implant community: A cross-sectional study and validation of automated topic modelling.,Clinical otolaryngology : official journal of ENT-UK ; official journal of Netherlands Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology & Cervico-Facial Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of research examining patient experiences of cochlear implants. We sought to use natural language processing methods to  explore patient experiences and concerns in the online cochlear implant (CI)  community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of posts on the online  Reddit r/CochlearImplants forum from 1 March 2015 to 11 November 2021. Natural  language processing using the BERTopic automated topic modelling technique was  employed to cluster posts into semantically similar topics. Topic categorisation  was manually validated by two independent reviewers and Cohen's kappa calculated  to determine inter-rater reliability between machine vs human and human vs human  categorisation. RESULTS: We retrieved 987 posts from 588 unique Reddit users on  the r/CochlearImplants forum. Posts were initially categorised by BERTopic into  16 different Topics, which were increased to 23 Topics following manual  inspection. The most popular topics related to CI connectivity (n = 112), adults  considering getting a CI (n = 107), surgery-related posts (n = 89) and day-to-day  living with a CI (n = 85). Cohen's kappa among all posts was 0.62 (machine vs.  human) and 0.72 (human vs. human), and among categorised posts was 0.85 (machine  vs. human) and 0.84 (human vs. human). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study of  social media discussions among the online cochlear implant community identified  common attitudes, experiences and concerns of patients living with, or seeking, a  cochlear implant. Our validation of natural language processing methods to  categorise topics shows that automated analysis of similar Otolaryngology-related  content is a viable and accurate alternative to manual qualitative approaches.",1
2022,Early white matter connectivity and plasticity in post stroke aphasia recovery.,NeuroImage. Clinical,"A disruption of white matter connectivity is negatively associated with language (recovery) in patients with aphasia after stroke, and behavioral gains have been  shown to coincide with white matter neuroplasticity. However, most brain-behavior  studies have been carried out in the chronic phase after stroke, with limited  generalizability to earlier phases. Furthermore, few studies have investigated  neuroplasticity patterns during spontaneous recovery (i.e., not related to a  specific treatment) in the first months after stroke, hindering the investigation  of potential early compensatory mechanisms. Finally, the majority of previous  research has focused on damaged left hemisphere pathways, while neglecting the  potential protective value of their right hemisphere counterparts for language  recovery. To address these outstanding issues, we present a longitudinal study of  thirty-two patients with aphasia (21 males and 11 females, M = 69.47 years,  SD = 10.60 years) who were followed up for a period of 1 year with test moments  in the acute (1-2 weeks), subacute (3-6 months) and chronic phase (9-12 months)  after stroke. Constrained Spherical Deconvolution-based tractography was  performed in the acute and subacute phase to measure Fiber Bundle Capacity (FBC),  a quantitative connectivity measure that is valid in crossing fiber regions, in  the bilateral dorsal arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the bilateral ventral inferior  fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). First, concurrent analyses revealed positive  associations between the left AF and phonology, and between the bilateral IFOF  and semantics in the acute - but not subacute - phase, supporting the dual-stream  language model. Second, neuroplasticity analyses revealed a decrease in  connection density of the bilateral AF - but not the IFOF - from the acute to the  subacute phase, possibly reflecting post stroke white matter degeneration in  areas adjacent to the lesion. Third, predictive analyses revealed no contribution  of acute FBC measures to the prediction of later language outcomes over and above  the initial language scores, suggesting no added value ofthe diffusion measures  for languageprediction. Our study provides new insights on (changes in)  connectivity of damaged and undamaged language pathways in patients with aphasia  in the first months after stroke, as well as if/how such measures are related to  language outcomes at different stages of recovery. Individual results are  discussed in the light of current frameworks of language processing and aphasia  recovery.",0
2023,Keyword-augmented and semi-automatic generation of FESS reports: a proof-of-concept study.,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Surgical reports are usually written after a procedure and must often be reproduced from memory. Thus, this is an error-prone, and time-consuming  task which increases the workload of physicians. In this proof-of-concept study,  we developed and evaluated a software tool using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for  semi-automatic intraoperative generation of surgical reports for functional  endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A vocabulary of keywords  for developing a neural language model was created. With an  encoder-decoder-architecture, artificially coherent sentence structures, as they  would be expected in general operation reports, were generated. A first set of 48  conventional operation reports were used for model training. After training, the  reports were generated again and compared to those before training. Established  metrics were used to measure optimization of the model objectively. A cohort of  16 physicians corrected and evaluated three randomly selected, generated reports  in four categories: ""quality of the generated operation reports,"" ""time-saving,""  ""clinical benefits"" and ""comparison with the conventional reports."" The  corrections of the generated reports were counted and categorized. RESULTS:  Objective parameters showed improvement in performance after training the  language model (p < 0.001). 27.78% estimated a timesaving of 1-15 and 61.11% of  16-30 min per day. 66.66% claimed to see a clinical benefit and 61.11% a relevant  workload reduction. Similarity in content between generated and conventional  reports was seen by 33.33%, similarity in form by 27.78%. 66.67% would use this  tool in the future. An average of 23.25 ± 12.5 corrections was needed for a  subjectively appropriate surgery report. CONCLUSION: The results indicate  existing limitations of applying deep learning to text generation of operation  reports and show a high acceptance by the physicians. By taking over this  time-consuming task, the tool could reduce workload, optimize clinical workflows  and improve the quality of patient care. Further training of the language model  is needed.",1
2022,Guideline for the treatment of no light perception eyes induced by mechanical ocular trauma.,Journal of evidence-based medicine,"Severe mechanical ocular trauma with no light perception (NLP) predicts a poor prognosis of visual acuity and enucleation of the eyeball. Since the innovative  treatment concept of exploratory vitreoretinal surgery has developed and  treatment technology has advanced, the outcomes of severe ocular trauma treatment  in NLP patients have greatly improved. However, there remains a lack of unified  standards for the determination, surgical indication, and timing of vitrectomy in  NLP eye treatment. To address these problems, we aimed to create evidence-based  medical guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mechanical  ocular trauma with NLP. Sixteen relevant recommendations for mechanical ocular  trauma with NLP were obtained, and a consensus was reached. Each recommendation  was explained in detail to guide the treatment of mechanical ocular trauma  associated with NLP.",0
2022,High Incidence and Unique Features of Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19 Infection.,Stroke,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) secondary to vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is an extremely rare side effect of adenovirus-based  COVID-19 vaccines. CVST incidence associated with COVID-19 itself has not been  widely reported. We report the incidence of CVST in patients hospitalized with  COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed  de-identified electronic medical records of a retrospective cohort of patients  admitted with COVID-19 to >200 hospitals between March 2020 and March 2021. We  used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes and natural  language processing extracts to identify patients with a new CVST diagnosis  during COVID-19 hospitalization. The primary outcome was CVST incidence in  hospitalized, COVID-19-positive patients. Secondary outcomes included CVST  incidence and mortality. Incidence rates were calculated using the  DerSimonian-Laird estimator method. RESULTS: Ninety-one thousand seven hundred  twenty-seven patients were evaluated; 22 had new CVST diagnoses by electronic  medical record review. CVST incidence in the hospitalized COVID-19 cohort was 231  per 1 000 000 person-years (95% CI, 152.1-350.8). Females<50 had the highest  incidence overall (males <50: 378.4 [142-1008.2]; females<50: 796.5  [428.6-1480.4]). In patients ≥50 years old, males had a higher estimated CVST  incidence (males≥50: 130.5 [54.3-313.6]; females≥50: 88.8 [28.6-275.2]). Older  patients (45.5% of patients ≥50 versus 0% of <50 years of age, P=0.012) and males  (44.4% of males versus 7.7% of females, P=0.023) were more likely to die in  hospital. CONCLUSIONS: CVST incidence in COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients  is high. Advanced age and male gender were associated with likelihood of death in  hospital; further studies are required to confirm these findings.",0
2022,A Machine Learning Model to Predict Citation Counts of Scientific Papers in Otology Field.,BioMed research international,"One of the most widely used measures of scientific impact is the number of citations. However, due to its heavy-tailed distribution, citations are  fundamentally difficult to predict but can be improved. This study was aimed at  investigating the factors and parts influencing the citation number of a  scientific paper in the otology field. Therefore, this work proposes a new  solution that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to  process English text and provides a paper citation as the predicted results.  Different algorithms are implemented in this solution, such as linear regression,  boosted decision tree, decision forest, and neural networks. The application of  neural network regression revealed that papers' abstracts have more influence on  the citation numbers of otological articles. This new solution has been developed  in visual programming using Microsoft Azure machine learning at the back end and  Programming Without Coding Technology at the front end. We recommend using  machine learning models to improve the abstracts of research articles to get more  citations.",1
2022,Deep-ADCA: Development and Validation of Deep Learning Model for Automated Diagnosis Code Assignment Using Clinical Notes in Electronic Medical Records.,Journal of personalized medicine,"Currently, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes are being used to improve clinical, financial, and administrative performance. Inaccurate  ICD coding can lower the quality of care, and delay or prevent reimbursement.  However, selecting the appropriate ICD code from a patient's clinical history is  time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. The rapid spread of electronic  medical records (EMRs) has generated a large amount of clinical data and provides  an opportunity to predict ICD codes using deep learning models. The main  objective of this study was to use a deep learning-based natural language  processing (NLP) model to accurately predict ICD-10 codes, which could help  providers to make better clinical decisions and improve their level of service.  We retrospectively collected clinical notes from five outpatient departments  (OPD) from one university teaching hospital between January 2016 and December  2016. We applied NLP techniques, including global vectors, word to vectors, and  embedding techniques to process the data. The dataset was split into two  independent training and testing datasets consisting of 90% and 10% of the entire  dataset, respectively. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed,  and the performance was measured using the precision, recall, and F-score. A  total of 21,953 medical records were collected from 5016 patients. The  performance of the CNN model for the five different departments was clinically  satisfactory (Precision: 0.50~0.69 and recall: 0.78~0.91). However, the CNN model  achieved the best performance for the cardiology department, with a precision of  69%, a recall of 89% and an F-score of 78%. The CNN model for predicting ICD-10  codes provides an opportunity to improve the quality of care. Implementing this  model in real-world clinical settings could reduce the manual coding workload,  enhance the efficiency of clinical coding, and support physicians in making  better clinical decisions.",0
2023,A Deep Learning Model for Classification of Parotid Neoplasms Based on Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Image Sequences.,The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVE: To design a deep learning model based on multimodal magnetic resonance image (MRI) sequences for automatic parotid neoplasm classification, and to  improve the diagnostic decision-making in clinical settings. METHODS: First,  multimodal MRI sequences were collected from 266 patients with parotid neoplasms,  and an artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning model was designed from  scratch, combining the image classification network of Resnet and the Transformer  network of Natural language processing. Second, the effectiveness of the deep  learning model was improved through the multi-modality fusion of MRI sequences,  and the fusion strategy of various MRI sequences was optimized. In addition, we  compared the effectiveness of the model in the parotid neoplasm classification  with experienced radiologists. RESULTS: The deep learning model delivered  reliable outcomes in differentiating benign and malignant parotid neoplasms. The  model, which was trained by the fusion of T2-weighted, postcontrast T1-weighted,  and diffusion-weighted imaging (b = 1000 s/mm(2) ), produced the best result,  with an accuracy score of 0.85, an area under the receiver operator  characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.96, a sensitivity score of 0.90, and a  specificity score of 0.84. In addition, the multi-modal paradigm exhibited  reliable outcomes in diagnosing the pleomorphic adenoma and the Warthin tumor,  but not in the identification of the basal cell adenoma. CONCLUSION: An accurate  and efficient AI based classification model was produced to classify parotid  neoplasms, resulting from the fusion of multimodal MRI sequences. The  effectiveness certainly outperformed the model with single MRI images or single  MRI sequences as input, and potentially, experienced radiologists.

2022,Integrating convolution and self-attention improves language model of human genome for interpreting non-coding regions at base-resolution.,Nucleic acids research,"Interpretation of non-coding genome remains an unsolved challenge in human genetics due to impracticality of exhaustively annotating biochemically active  elements in all conditions. Deep learning based computational approaches emerge  recently to help interpret non-coding regions. Here, we present LOGO (Language of  Genome), a self-attention based contextualized pre-trained language model  containing only two self-attention layers with 1 million parameters as a  substantially light architecture that applies self-supervision techniques to  learn bidirectional representations of the unlabelled human reference genome.  LOGO is then fine-tuned for sequence labelling task, and further extended to  variant prioritization task via a special input encoding scheme of alternative  alleles followed by adding a convolutional module. Experiments show that LOGO  achieves 15% absolute improvement for promoter identification and up to 4.5%  absolute improvement for enhancer-promoter interaction prediction. LOGO exhibits  state-of-the-art multi-task predictive power on thousands of chromatin features  with only 3% parameterization benchmarking against the fully supervised model,  DeepSEA and 1% parameterization against a recent BERT-based DNA language model.  For allelic-effect prediction, locality introduced by one dimensional convolution  shows improved sensitivity and specificity for prioritizing non-coding variants  associated with human diseases. In addition, we apply LOGO to interpret type 2  diabetes (T2D) GWAS signals and infer underlying regulatory mechanisms. We make a  conceptual analogy between natural language and human genome and demonstrate LOGO  is an accurate, fast, scalable, and robust framework to interpret non-coding  regions for global sequence labeling as well as for variant prioritization at  base-resolution.",0
2023,Advances in Artificial Intelligence to Diagnose Otitis Media: State of the Art Review.,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Otitis media (OM) is a model disease for developing, validating, and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. We aim to review the state  of the art applications of AI used to diagnose OM in pediatric and adult  populations. DATA SOURCES: Several comprehensive databases were searched to  identify all articles that applied AI technologies to diagnose OM. REVIEW  METHODS: Relevant articles from January 2010 through May 2021 were identified by  title and abstract. Articles were excluded if they did not discuss AI in  conjunction with diagnosing OM. References of included studies and relevant  review articles were cross-referenced to identify any additional studies.  CONCLUSION: Title and abstract screening resulted in full-text retrieval of 40  articles that met initial screening parameters. Of this total, secondary review  articles (n = 7) and commentary-based articles (n = 2) were removed, as were  articles that did not specifically discuss AI and OM diagnosis (n = 5), leaving  25 articles for review. Applications of AI technologies specific to diagnosing OM  included machine learning and natural language processing (n = 23) and prototype  approaches (n = 2). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This review emphasizes the utility  of AI techniques to automate and aid in diagnosing OM. Although these techniques  are still in the development and testing stages, AI has the potential to improve  the practice of otolaryngologists and primary care clinicians by increasing the  efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses.",1
2022,HAS: Hybrid Analysis of Sentiments for the perspective of customer review summarization.,Journal of ambient intelligence and humanized computing,"The reviews posted online by the end-users can help the business owners obtain a fair evaluation of their products/services and take the necessary steps. However,  due to the large volume of online reviews being generated from time to time, it  becomes challenging for business owners to track each review. The Customer Review  Summarization (CRS) model that can present the summarized information and offer  businesses with significant acumens to understand the reason behind customers'  choices and behavior, would therefore be desirable. We propose the Hybrid  Analysis of Sentiments (HAS) for the perspective of effective CRS in this paper.  The HAS consists of steps like pre-processing, feature extraction, and review  classification. The pre-processing phase removes the unwanted data from the text  reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) based on different pre-processing  functions. For efficient feature extraction, the hybrid mechanism consisting of  aspect-related features and review-related features is proposed to build the  unique feature vector for each customer review. Review classification is  performed using different supervised classifiers like Support Vector Machine  (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest. The experimental results show that HAS  efficiently performed the sentiment analysis and outperformed the existing  state-of-the-art techniques with an F1 score of 92.2%.",0
2022,Recovery of vision after treatment of hemodialysis related bilateral optic nerve ischemia.,American journal of ophthalmology case reports,"PURPOSE: We present the case of a patient who lost light perception in both eyes after hemodialysis and subsequently recovered vision after treatment with  erythropoietin and intravenous steroids. OBSERVATIONS: Our patient reported loss  of light perception in both eyes (NLP) 2 hours after hemodialysis. Examination  confirmed NLP vision, chronic retinal vascular changes, and no acute changes in  optic nerve appearance. A presumptive diagnosis of posterior optic neuropathy was  made. The patient was treated with erythropoietin and intravenous steroids  according to the protocol of Nikkah. Over a period of 14 hours, he recovered  vision to his baseline. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Bilateral loss of light  perception is a rare complication of hemodialysis. The presumed mechanism is  posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Prompt treatment with erythropoietin and  intravenous steroids should be considered in similar situations that result in  Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION) related to procedure-based  hypotension.",0
2022,Online Discussions About Tinnitus: What Can We Learn From Natural Language Processing of Reddit Posts?,American journal of audiology,"BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at identifying key topics in online discussions about tinnitus by examining a large data set extracted from Reddit social media  using a natural language processing technique. METHOD: A corpus of 113,215 posts  about tinnitus was extracted from Reddit's application programming interface.  After cleaning the data for duplications and posts without any text information,  the sample was reduced to 101,905 posts, which was subjected to cluster analysis  using the open-source IRaMuTeQ software to identify main topics based on the  co-occurrence of texts. These clusters were named by a panel of tinnitus experts  (n = 9) by reading typical text segments within each cluster. RESULTS: The  cluster analysis identified 16 unique clusters that belong to two topics, which  were named ""tinnitus causes and consequences"" and ""tinnitus management and  coping."" Based on their characteristics, the clusters were named: tinnitus  timeline (10%), tinnitus perception (9.7%), medical triggers and modulators  (8.8%), hearing research (8.8%), attention and silence (8.6%), social media posts  about tinnitus (7.4%), hearing protection (7.3%), interaction with hearing health  care providers (6.7%), mental health and coping (5.8%), music listening (5.7%),  hope for a cure (5.6%), interactions with people without tinnitus (5.4%), dietary  supplements and alternative therapies (3.2%), sleep (3.9%), dietary effects  (1.7%), and writing about tinnitus and being thankful to online community (1.4%).  CONCLUSIONS: Despite some limitations, tinnitus posts on Reddit provide rich  real-world data to identify various issues and complaints that tinnitus patients  and their significant others discuss in online communities. Some of the clusters  identified here are novel (e.g., tinnitus timeline, interactions with people  without tinnitus) and have not been much discussed in the tinnitus literature.  The results suggest that individuals with tinnitus relay on social media for  support and highlight the service delivery needs in providing social support  through other means (e.g., support groups).",1
2021,Data Mining of Free-Text Responses: An Innovative Approach to Analyzing Patient Perspectives on Treatment for Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps in a Phase  IIa Proof-of-Concept Study for Dupilumab.,Patient preference and adherence,"PURPOSE: Patient perspective is an important and increasingly sought-after complement to clinical assessment. The aim of this study was to transcribe  individual patients' experience of treatment in a dupilumab clinical trial  through free-text responses with analysis using natural language processing (NLP)  to obtain the unique perspective of patients on disease impact and unmet needs  with existing treatment to inform future trial design. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) who were enrolled  in a Phase IIa randomized controlled trial comparing dupilumab with placebo  (NCT01920893) were invited to complete a self-assessment of treatment (SAT) tool  at the end of treatment, asking, ""What is your opinion on the treatment you had  during the trial? What did you like or dislike about the treatment?"" Free-text  responses were analyzed for the overall cohort and according to treatment  assignment using natural language processing including sentiment scoring. In a  mixed-methods approach, quantitative patient-reported outcome (PRO) results were  utilized to complement the qualitative analysis of free-text responses. RESULTS:  Of 60 patients enrolled in the study, 43 (71.6%) completed the SAT and responses  from 37 patients were analyzed (placebo, n = 16; dupilumab, n = 21). Word  analyses showed that the most common words were ""smell,"" ""improve,"" ""staff,""  ""great,"" ""time,"" and ""good."" Across the whole cohort, ""smell"" was the most common  symptom-related word. The words ""smell"" and ""experience"" were more likely to  occur in patients treated with dupilumab. Patients treated with dupilumab also  had more positive sentiment in their SAT responses than those who received  placebo. The results from this qualitative analysis were reflected in  quantitative PRO results. CONCLUSION: ""Smell"" was important to patients with  CRSwNP, highlighting its importance as a patient-centric efficacy outcome measure  in the context of clinical trials in CRSwNP.

2022,Significant Vision Recovery from Filler-Induced Complete Blindness with Combined Intra-Arterial Injection of Hyaluronidase and Thrombolytic Agents.,Aesthetic plastic surgery,"With the increase of cosmetic injectable hyaluronic acid (HA), there have been more cases with serious complications, including skin necrosis, blindness, and  cerebral embolism. Patients who have recovered from HA filler-induced total  vision loss are extremely rare. We report a case of a 27-year-old female who  developed severe ocular pain on the right side and total vision loss following a  1.0 ml HA filler injection in the nasal dorsum. She arrived at our hospital 4  hours later. Her visual acuity was no light perception (NLP), and she exhibited  eyelid ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and frontal and nasal ecchymosis. She was  promptly treated with subcutaneous and retrobulbar hyaluronidase injections, as  well as intra-arterial 1500 IU hyaluronidase injections into the right ophthalmic  artery with DSA assistance. Her vision improved from NLP to counting fingers at  1.0 meters. Unfortunately, 13 hours later, she felt an intense headache, and her  vision again decreased to NLP. We immediately performed an injection of 1500 IU  hyaluronidase combined with 8 mg alteplase for intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT)  into the right ophthalmic artery. Her vision improved immediately afterward.  After 3 months, her visual acuity had significantly recovered from NLP (admission  vision status) to 20/50 (Snellen chart with glasses). Similarly, skin,  conjunctival, eye movement, and ptosis symptoms completely recovered. This case  demonstrates that reversal of complete blindness due to embolism of the  ophthalmic and central retinal arteries could be accomplished through  multidisciplinary therapies, especially IAT using fibrinolytic agents combined  with hyaluronidase followed by an anticoagulant regimen.Level of evidence VThis  journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

2021,Electronic Medical Records as Input to Predict Postoperative Immediate Remission of Cushing's Disease: Application of Word Embedding.,Frontiers in oncology,"BACKGROUND: No existing machine learning (ML)-based models use free text from electronic medical records (EMR) as input to predict immediate remission (IR) of  Cushing's disease (CD) after transsphenoidal surgery. PURPOSE: The aim of the  present study is to develop an ML-based model that uses EMR that include both  structured features and free text as input to preoperatively predict IR after  transsphenoidal surgery. METHODS: A total of 419 patients with CD from Peking  Union Medical College Hospital were enrolled between January 2014 and August  2020. The EMR of the patients were embedded and transformed into low-dimensional  dense vectors that can be included in four ML-based models together with  structured features. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating  characteristic curves was used to evaluate the performance of the models.  RESULTS: The overall remission rate of the 419 patients was 75.7%. From the  results of logistic multivariate analysis, operation (p < 0.001), invasion of  cavernous sinus from MRI (p = 0.046), and ACTH (p = 0.024) were strongly  correlated with IR. The AUC values for the four ML-based models ranged from 0.686  to 0.793. The highest AUC value (0.793) was for logistic regression when 11  structured features and ""individual conclusions of the case by doctor"" were  included. CONCLUSION: An ML-based model was developed using both structured and  unstructured features (after being processed using a word embedding method) as  input to preoperatively predict postoperative IR.",0
2021,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis is not Significantly Linked to COVID-19 Vaccines or Non-COVID Vaccines in a Large Multi-State Health System.,Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of COVID-19 vaccines and non-COVID-19 vaccines with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). MATERIALS AND METHOD: We  retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 771,805 vaccination events across 266,094  patients in the Mayo Clinic Health System between 01/01/2017 and 03/15/2021. The  primary outcome was a positive diagnosis of CVST, identified either by the  presence of a corresponding ICD code or by an NLP algorithm which detected  positive diagnosis of CVST within free-text clinical notes. For each vaccine we  calculated the relative risk by dividing the incidence of CVST in the 30 days  following vaccination to that in the 30 days preceding vaccination. RESULTS: We  identified vaccination events for all FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines including  Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n = 36,350 doses) and Johnson &  Johnson - J&J (n = 1,745 doses). We also identified vaccinations events for 10  common FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n = 771,805 doses). There was no  statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of CVST in 30-days  before and after vaccination for any vaccine in this population. We further found  the baseline CVST incidence in the study population between 2017 and 2021 to be  45 to 98 per million patient years. CONCLUSIONS: This real-world evidence-based  study finds that CVST is rare and is not significantly associated with COVID-19  vaccination in our patient cohort. Limitations include the rarity of CVST in our  dataset, a relatively small number of J&J COVID-19 vaccination events, and the  use of a population drawn from recipients of a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test in a single  health system.",0
2022,"The hidden stigma of aging and COVID-19: aggravating factors and strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in older adults, a text mining analysis.",Aging & mental health,"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with mental health of older adults during the pandemic and to provide strategies to mitigate their psychosocial  impact in the elderly. METHOD: An integrative text mining analysis in Medline was  performed to identify studies on the mental health of older adults during the  pandemic. Subsequently, statistical topic modeling was performed to identify the  most prevalent terms and topics discussed in included studies. RESULTS: A total  of 29 studies were retrieved until July 1st 2020, including a majority of letters  (12 studies) and commentaries (8 studies). The most frequent terms overall were:  loneliness (n = 137), support (n = 132), home (n = 102), suicide (n = 96) and  help (n = 94). The most prevalent terms were then divided in five topics: home  (33%), suicide (32%), apps (15%), loneliness (12%) and physical activity (9%).  Additionally, a section focused on low- and middle-income countries was included.  A summary of strategies to mitigate the effects of pandemic in mental health of  older adults was also provided. CONCLUSION: These factors demonstrate the  importance of developing strategies for psychosocial support that take into  consideration the particularities of the elderly. Different levels of care are  immediately necessary to diminish the devastating impact of the pandemic in the  mental health of older adults.",0
2022,Association of Preinjury Medical Diagnoses With Pediatric Persistent Postconcussion Symptoms in Electronic Health Records.,The Journal of head trauma rehabilitation,"OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors and generate hypotheses for pediatric persistent postconcussion symptoms (PPCS). SETTING: A regional healthcare system  in the Southeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: An electronic health  record-based algorithm was developed and validated to identify PPCS cases and  controls from an institutional database of more than 2.8 million patients. PPCS  cases (n = 274) were patients aged 5 to 18 years with PPCS-related diagnostic  codes or with PPCS key words identified by natural language processing of  clinical notes. Age, sex, and year of index event-matched controls (n = 1096)  were patients with mild traumatic brain injury codes only. Patients with moderate  or severe traumatic brain injury were excluded. All patients used our healthcare  system at least 3 times 180 days before their injury. DESIGN: Case-control study.  MAIN MEASURES: The outcome was algorithmic classification of PPCS. Exposures were  all preinjury medical diagnoses assigned at least 180 days before the injury.  RESULTS: Cases and controls both had a mean of more than 9 years of healthcare  system use preinjury. Of 221 preinjury medical diagnoses, headache disorder was  associated with PPCS after accounting for multiple testing (odds ratio [OR] =  2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-5.0; P = 2.1e-4). Six diagnoses were  associated with PPCS at a suggestive threshold for statistical significance  (false discovery rate P < .10): gastritis/duodenitis (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.6-5.1;  P = 5.0e-4), sleep disorders (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.4-3.7; P = 7.4e-4), abdominal  pain (OR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2; P = 9.2e-4), chronic sinusitis (OR = 2.8; 95%  CI: 1.5-5.2; P = 1.3e-3), congenital anomalies of the skin (OR = 2.9; 95% CI:  1.5-5.5; P = 1.9e-3), and chronic pharyngitis/nasopharyngitis (OR = 2.4; 95% CI:  1.4-4.3; P = 2.5e-3). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the strong association  of preinjury headache disorders with PPCS. An association of PPCS with prior  gastritis/duodenitis, sinusitis, and pharyngitis/nasopharyngitis suggests a role  for chronic inflammation in PPCS pathophysiology and risk, although results could  equally be attributable to a higher likelihood of somatization among PPCS cases.  Identified risk factors should be investigated further and potentially considered  during the management of pediatric mild traumatic brain injury cases.",0
2021,Identification of key genes and pathways in scleral extracellular matrix remodeling in glaucoma: Potential therapeutic agents discovered using  bioinformatics analysis.,International journal of medical sciences,"Background: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Remodeling of the scleral extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the development  of glaucoma. The aim of this study was to identify the key genes and pathways for  the ECM remodeling of sclera in glaucoma by bioinformatics analysis and to  explore potential therapeutic agents for glaucoma management. Methods: Genes  associated with glaucoma, sclera and ECM remodeling were detected using the text  mining tool pubmed2ensembl, and assigned Gene Ontology (GO) biological process  terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using the  GeneCodis program. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by  STRING and visualized in Cytoscape, module analysis was performed using the  Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plugin, and GO and KEGG analyses of the gene  modules were performed using the Database of Annotation, Visualization and  Integrated Discovery (DAVID) platform. The genes that clustered in the  significant module were selected as core genes, and functions and pathways of the  core genes were visualized using ClueGO and CluePedia. Lastly, the drug-gene  interaction database was used to explore drug-gene interactions of the core genes  to find drug candidates for glaucoma. Results: We identified 125 genes common to  ""Glaucoma"", ""Sclera"", and ""ECM remodeling"" by text mining. Gene functional  enrichment analysis yielded 30 enriched GO terms and 20 associated KEGG pathways.  A PPI network that included 60 nodes with 249 edges was constructed, and three  gene modules were obtained using the MCODE. We selected 13 genes that clustered  in module 1 as core candidate genes that were associated mainly with ECM  degradation and cell proliferation and division. The HIF-1 signaling pathway,  FOXO signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and TGFB signaling pathway  were found to be enriched. We found that 11 of the 13 selected genes could be  targeted by 26 existing drugs. Conclusions: The results showed that VEGFA, TGFB1,  TGFB2, TGFB3, IGF2, IGF1, EGF, FN1, KNG1, TIMP1, SERPINE1, THBS1, and VWF were  potential key genes involved to scleral ECM remodeling. Furthermore, 26 drugs  were identified as potential therapeutic agents for glaucoma treatment and  management.",0
2021,Atrial fibrillation is an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality in patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection.,Heart rhythm,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most encountered arrhythmia and has been associated with worse in-hospital outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study was to  determine the incidence of AF in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID-19) as well as its impact on in-hospital mortality. METHODS: Patients  hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test between  March 1 and April 27, 2020, were identified from the common medical record system  of 13 Northwell Health hospitals. Natural language processing search algorithms  were used to identify and classify AF. Patients were classified as having AF or  not. AF was further classified as new-onset AF vs history of AF. RESULTS: AF  occurred in 1687 of 9564 patients (17.6%). Of those, 1109 patients (65.7%) had  new-onset AF. Propensity score matching of 1238 pairs of patients with AF and  without AF showed higher in-hospital mortality in the AF group (54.3% vs 37.2%; P  < .0001). Within the AF group, propensity score matching of 500 pairs showed  higher in-hospital mortality in patients with new-onset AF as compared with those  with a history of AF (55.2% vs 46.8%; P = .009). The risk ratio of in-hospital  mortality for new-onset AF in patients with sinus rhythm was 1.56 (95% confidence  interval 1.42-1.71; P < .0001). The presence of cardiac disease was not  associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with AF (P =  .1). CONCLUSION: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 17.6% experienced AF.  AF, particularly new-onset, was an independent predictor of in-hospital  mortality.",0
2021,Documented Reasons of Cancellation and Rescheduling of Telehealth Appointments During the Pandemic.,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,"Background and Objective:The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telehealth around the world. The aim is to minimize health care service disruption as well  as reducing COVID-19 exposure. However, one of the major operational concerns is  cancellations and rescheduling (C/Rs). C/Rs may create additional burden and cost  to the patient, provider, and the health system. Our aim is to understand the  reasons for C/Rs of the telehealth session after the scheduled start  time.Materials and Methods:We reviewed electronic health records (EHRs) to  identify the C/R reasons for behavioral health and speech language pathology  departments. Documented C/Rs in the medical charts were identified from EHR by  using a keyword-based and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-supported EHR search  engine. From the search results, we randomly selected 200 notes and conducted a  thematic analysis.Results:We identified four themes explaining C/R reasons. Most  frequent theme was ""technicality"" (47, 36%), followed by ""engagement"" (34, 25%),  ""scheduling"" (31, 24%), and ""unspecified"" (20, 15%). The findings showed that  technical reasons are the leading cause of C/Rs, constituting 36% of the cases  (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-43%). Notably, ""engagement"" constituted a  sizeable 25% (95% CI: 19-31%) of C/Rs, as a result of the inability to engage a  patient to complete the telehealth session.Conclusions:The study shows that  engagement is one of the new challenges to the pediatric telehealth visits.  Future studies of new engagement models are needed for the success of telehealth.  Our findings will help fill the literature gaps and may help with enhancing the  digital experience for both caregivers and providers, reducing wasted time and  resources due to preventable C/Rs, improving clinical operation efficiency, and  treatment adherence.",0
2021,Technological evolution of cyclodextrins in the pharmaceutical field.,Journal of drug delivery science and technology,"We herein disclose how global cyclodextrin-based pharmaceutical technologies have evolved since the early 80s through a 1998 patents dataset retrieved from Derwent  Innovation Index. We used text-mining techniques based on the patents semantic  content to extract the knowledge contained therein, to analyze technologies  related to the principal attributes of CDs: solubility, stability, and  taste-masking enhancement. The majority of CDs pharmaceutical technologies are  directed toward parenteral aqueous solutions. The development of oral and ocular  formulations is rapidly growing, while technologies for nasal and pulmonary  routes are emerging and seem to be promising. Formulations for topical,  transdermal, vaginal, and rectal routes do not account for a high number of  patents, but they may be hiding a great potential, representing opportunity  research areas. Certainly, the progress in materials sciences, supramolecular  chemistry, and nanotechnology, will influence the trend of that, apparently  neglected, research. The bottom line, CDs pharmaceutical technologies are still  increasing, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. Patent  monitoring allows the identification of relevant technologies and trends to  prioritize research, development, and investment in both, academia and industry.  We expect the scope of this approach to be applied in the pharmaceutical field  beyond CDs technological applications.",0

2020,Language-based translation and prediction of surgical navigation steps for endoscopic wayfinding assistance in minimally invasive surgery.,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,"PURPOSE: In the context of aviation and automotive navigation technology, assistance functions are associated with predictive planning and wayfinding  tasks. In endoscopic minimally invasive surgery, however, assistance so far  relies primarily on image-based localization and classification. We show that  navigation workflows can be described and used for the prediction of navigation  steps. METHODS: A natural description vocabulary for observable anatomical  landmarks in endoscopic images was defined to create 3850 navigation workflow  sentences from 22 annotated functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS)  recordings. Resulting FESS navigation workflows showed an imbalanced data  distribution with over-represented landmarks in the ethmoidal sinus. A  transformer model was trained to predict navigation sentences in  sequence-to-sequence tasks. The training was performed with the Adam optimizer  and label smoothing in a leave-one-out cross-validation study. The sentences were  generated using an adapted beam search algorithm with exponential decay beam  rescoring. The transformer model was compared to a standard  encoder-decoder-model, as well as HMM and LSTM baseline models. RESULTS: The  transformer model reached the highest prediction accuracy for navigation steps at  0.53, followed by 0.35 of the LSTM and 0.32 for the standard  encoder-decoder-network. With an accuracy of sentence generation of 0.83, the  prediction of navigation steps at sentence-level benefits from the additional  semantic information. While standard class representation predictions suffer from  an imbalanced data distribution, the attention mechanism also considered  underrepresented classes reasonably well. CONCLUSION: We implemented a natural  language-based prediction method for sentence-level navigation steps in  endoscopic surgery. The sentence-level prediction method showed a potential that  word relations to navigation tasks can be learned and used for predicting future  steps. Further studies are needed to investigate the functionality of path  prediction. The prediction approach is a first step in the field of  visuo-linguistic navigation assistance for endoscopic minimally invasive surgery.",1
2020,Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit During COVID-19: Observational Study.,Journal of medical Internet research,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially  impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to  leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing  changes in 15 of the world's largest mental health support groups (eg,  r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along  with 11 non-mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the  initial stage of the pandemic. METHODS: We created and released the Reddit Mental  Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using  regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment  analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine  learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and  interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in  language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised  clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic.  RESULTS: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about  COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups  started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly  increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories ""economic  stress,"" ""isolation,"" and ""home,"" while others such as ""motion"" significantly  decreased. We found that support groups related to  attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed  the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health  groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through  independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance,  we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are  converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users  posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental  health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ=-0.96, P<.001). Using  unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more  than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the  support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress  disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster.  Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged.  CONCLUSIONS: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of  prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems  manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of  concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions  of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover  mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable  groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the  ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests.",0
2020,Formal representation of patients' care context data: the path to improving the electronic health record.,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a collection of concept-relationship-concept tuples to formally represent patients' care context data to inform electronic health record  (EHR) development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed semantic relationships  reported in the literature and developed a manual annotation schema. We used the  initial schema to annotate sentences extracted from narrative note sections of  cardiology, urology, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) notes. We audio recorded ENT  visits and annotated their parsed transcripts. We combined the results of each  annotation into a consolidated set of concept-relationship-concept tuples. We  then compared the tuples used within and across the multiple data sources.  RESULTS: We annotated a total of 626 sentences. Starting with 8 relationships  from the literature, we annotated 182 sentences from 8 inpatient consult notes  (initial set of tuples = 43). Next, we annotated 232 sentences from 10 outpatient  visit notes (enhanced set of tuples = 75). Then, we annotated 212 sentences from  transcripts of 5 outpatient visits (final set of tuples = 82). The tuples from  the visit transcripts covered 103 (74%) concepts documented in the notes of their  respective visits. There were 20 (24%) tuples used across all data sources, 10  (12%) used only in inpatient notes, 15 (18%) used only in visit notes, and 7 (9%)  used only in the visit transcripts. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a robust set of 82  tuples useful to represent patients' care context data. We propose several  applications of our tuples to improve EHR navigation, data entry, learning health  systems, and decision support.",0
2020,Toxicogenomic study to identify potential signaling alterations related to nasal inflammatory damages induced by diesel exhaust particles in primary human nasal  epithelial cells.,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,"In this study, we aimed to identify signaling alteration caused by exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) using primary human nasal epithelial cells  (PHNECs). Global gene expression profiles in PHNECs following 50 and 200 μg/ml of  DEP exposure were identified using microarray analysis. To cover the limitation  of array-based mRNA expression analysis, text-mining-based software was used to  analyze the integrative biological networks and relevant disease-focused  functions among identified DEP-responsive genes. The confidence was valued based  on the connectivity between the analyzed pathway and marker candidates. Through a  literature-based pathway analysis, the stimulation of inflammation- and immune  response-related processes mediated by TNF were predicted as major signaling  alterations in PHNECs caused by DEP exposure. CSF3, CXCL8, MMP1, and VEGFA were  identified as key hub genes in the predicted pathway. Significant expression  level changes in the five key genes following DEP exposure were validated in  terms of protein and mRNA expression. Although further studies are required, our  toxicogenomic investigation provides key clues to the exact mechanism underlying  DEP-induced nasal inflammatory damage. It also suggests an efficient approach for  other research on adverse effects occurring in the upper respiratory tract  following DEP exposure.",0
2021,Automated Detection of Periprosthetic Joint Infections and Data Elements Using Natural Language Processing.,The Journal of arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) data elements are contained in both structured and unstructured documents in electronic health records and  require manual data collection. The goal of this study is to develop a natural  language processing (NLP) algorithm to replicate manual chart review for PJI data  elements. METHODS: PJI was identified among all total joint arthroplasty (TJA)  procedures performed at a single academic institution between 2000 and 2017. Data  elements that comprise the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria were  manually extracted and used as the gold standard for validation. A training  sample of 1208 TJA surgeries (170 PJI cases) was randomly selected to develop the  prototype NLP algorithms and an additional 1179 surgeries (150 PJI cases) were  randomly selected as the test sample. The algorithms were applied to all  consultation notes, operative notes, pathology reports, and microbiology reports  to predict the correct status of PJI based on MSIS criteria. RESULTS: The  algorithm, which identified patients with PJI based on MSIS criteria, achieved an  f1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.911. Algorithm performance  in extracting the presence of sinus tract, purulence, pathologic documentation of  inflammation, and growth of cultured organisms from the involved TJA achieved  f1-scores that ranged from 0.771 to 0.982, sensitivity that ranged from 0.730 to  1.000, and specificity that ranged from 0.947 to 1.000. CONCLUSION: NLP-enabled  algorithms have the potential to automate data collection for PJI diagnostic  elements, which could directly improve patient care and augment cohort  surveillance and research efforts. Further validation is needed in other hospital  settings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Diagnostic.",0
2020,Characterization of Bacillus anthracis Spore Proteins Using a Nanoscaffold Vaccine Platform.,Frontiers in immunology,"Subunit vaccines are theoretically safe and easy to manufacture but require effective adjuvants and delivery systems to yield protective immunity,  particularly at critical mucosal sites such as the lung. We investigated  nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) containing the Toll-like receptor 4 agonist  monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as a platform for intranasal vaccination against  Bacillus anthracis. Modified lipids enabled attachment of disparate spore and  toxin protein antigens. Intranasal vaccination of mice with B. anthracis  antigen-MPLA-NLP constructs induced robust IgG and IgA responses in serum and in  bronchoalveolar and nasal lavage. Typically, a single dose sufficed to induce  sustained antibody titers over time. When multiple immunizations were required  for sustained titers, specific antibodies were detected earlier in the boost  schedule with MPLA-NLP-mediated delivery than with free MPLA. Administering  combinations of constructs induced responses to multiple antigens, indicating  potential for a multivalent vaccine preparation. No off-target responses to the  NLP scaffold protein were detected. In summary, the NLP platform enhances humoral  and mucosal responses to intranasal immunization, indicating promise for NLPs as  a flexible, robust vaccine platform against B. anthracis and potentially other  inhalational pathogens.",0
2021,Part of Speech Production in Patients With Primary Progressive Aphasia: An Analysis Based on Natural Language Processing.,American journal of speech-language pathology,"Background Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive decline of language functions. Its symptoms are  grouped into three PPA variants: nonfluent PPA, logopenic PPA, and semantic PPA.  Grammatical deficiencies differ depending on the PPA variant. Aims This study  aims to determine the differences between PPA variants with respect to part of  speech (POS) production and to identify morphological markers that classify PPA  variants using machine learning. By fulfilling these aims, the overarching goal  is to provide objective measures that can facilitate clinical diagnosis,  evaluation, and prognosis. Method and Procedure Connected speech productions from  PPA patients produced in a picture description task were transcribed, and the POS  class of each word was estimated using natural language processing, namely, POS  tagging. We then implemented a twofold analysis: (a) linear regression to  determine how patients with nonfluent PPA, semantic PPA, and logopenic PPA  variants differ in their POS productions and (b) a supervised classification  analysis based on POS using machine learning models (i.e., random forests,  decision trees, and support vector machines) to subtype PPA variants and generate  feature importance (FI). Outcome and Results Using an automated analysis of a  short picture description task, this study showed that content versus function  words can distinguish patients with nonfluent PPA, semantic PPA, and logopenic  PPA variants. Verbs were less important as distinguishing features of patients  with different PPA variants than earlier thought. Finally, the study showed that  among the most important distinguishing features of PPA variants were elaborative  speech elements, such as adjectives and adverbs.",0
2019,"Neuroanatomical structures supporting lexical diversity, sophistication, and phonological word features during discourse.",NeuroImage. Clinical,"Deficits in lexical retrieval are commonly observed in individuals with post-stroke aphasia. Successful lexical retrieval is related to lexical  diversity, lexical sophistication, and phonological word properties; however, the  crucial brain regions supporting these different features are not fully  understood. We performed MRI-based lesion symptom mapping in 58 individuals with  a chronic left hemisphere stroke to assess how regional damage relates to spoken  discourse-extracted measures of lexical diversity, lexical sophistication, and  phonological word properties. For discourse transcription and word feature  analysis, we used the Computerized Language Analysis (CLAN) program, Stanford  Core Natural Language Processing, Irvine Phonotactic Online Dictionary, Lexical  Complexity Analyzer, and Gramulator. Lesions involving the left posterior insula  and supramarginal gyri and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were significant  predictors of utterances with, on average, lower lexical diversity. Low lexical  sophistication was associated with damage to the left pole of the superior  temporal gyrus. Production of words with lower phonological complexity (fewer  phonemes, higher phonological similarity) was associated with damage to the left  supramarginal gyrus. Our findings indicate that discourse-extracted features of  lexical retrieval depend on the integrity of specific brain regions involving  insular and peri-Sylvian areas. The identified regions provide insight into  potentially underlying mechanisms of lexically diverse, sophisticated and  phonologically complex words produced during discourse.",0
2019,An Olfactory Sensor Array for Predicting Chemical Odor Characteristics from Mass Spectra with Deep Learning.,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","Machine learning techniques are useful for applications such as electronic nose (e-nose) systems to classify or identify the target odor. In recent years, deep  learning is regarded as one of the most powerful machine learning methods. It  enables researchers to extract useful features automatically from  high-dimensional raw data and has been widely applied to computer vision, speech  recognition, and natural language processing, though little has been reported in  the field of olfaction. In this chapter, we describe the procedure to build a  deep neural network to predict odor characteristics of chemicals from their mass  spectra.",0
2019,A digital workflow for modeling of custom dental implants.,3D printing in medicine,"Modern dental treatment with standard screw-type implants leave some cases unaddressed in patients with extreme jaw bone resorption. Custom-made  subperiosteal dental implant could be an alternative treatment modality to sinus  lift, nerve lateralization or zygomatic implant techniques. Subperiosteal dental  implants were utilized for many years to treat such patients. A combination of  traditional subperiosteal implant designs with current advancements in 3D  imaging, design and printing allow to reduces treatment time and provides  abutments for prostheses in cases where other techniques do not provide  satisfactory results. The data manipulation and design software are important  aspects in the manufacturing of custom implants. Programs that are specialized  for industrial or medical design typically cost tens of thousands of US dollars.  In this work I establish and test steps for design and production of a custom  medical device (subperiosteal implant) from patient computed tomography (CT)  data. Work stages to be defined are: selection of necessary software, CT data  processing, 3D virtual model creation, modeling technique for custom implant and  data file preparation for printing. Patient CT data was successfully converted  into a watertight STL (Standard Tessellation Language) model of the maxilla.  Error corrections and design were completed using freely available programs from  Autodesk Inc.. The implant was produced in Ti64 (a type 5 titanium alloy) using  three-dimensional (3D) printing DMLS (direct metal laser sintering) process. The  avoidance of high cost software makes this treatment modality more accessible to  smaller clinics or mid-size production facilities and subsequently more available  to patients.",0
2020,Reporting trends of p values in the neurosurgical literature.,Journal of neurosurgery,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the trends in reporting of p values in the neurosurgical literature from 1990 through 2017. METHODS: All  abstracts from the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (JNNP),  Journal of Neurosurgery (JNS) collection (including Journal of Neurosurgery:  Spine and Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics), Neurosurgery (NS), and Journal of  Neurotrauma (JNT) available on PubMed from 1990 through 2017 were retrieved.  Automated text mining was performed to extract p values from relevant abstracts.  Extracted p values were analyzed for temporal trends and characteristics.  RESULTS: The search yielded 47,889 relevant abstracts. A total of 34,324 p values  were detected in 11,171 abstracts. Since 1990 there has been a steady,  proportionate increase in the number of abstracts containing p values. There were  average absolute year-on-year increases of 1.2% (95% CI 1.1%-1.3%; p < 0.001),  0.93% (95% CI 0.75%-1.1%; p < 0.001), 0.70% (95% CI 0.57%-0.83%; p < 0.001), and  0.35% (95% CI 0.095%-0.60%; p = 0.0091) of abstracts reporting p values in JNNP,  JNS, NS, and JNT, respectively. There have also been average year-on-year  increases of 0.045 (95% CI 0.031-0.059; p < 0.001), 0.052 (95% CI 0.037-0.066; p  < 0.001), 0.042 (95% CI 0.030-0.054; p < 0.001), and 0.041 (95% CI 0.026-0.056; p  < 0.001) p values reported per abstract for these respective journals. The  distribution of p values showed a positive skew and strong clustering of values  at rounded decimals (i.e., 0.01, 0.02, etc.). Between 83.2% and 89.8% of all  reported p values were at or below the ""significance"" threshold of 0.05 (i.e., p  ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Trends in reporting of p values and the distribution of p  values suggest publication bias remains in the neurosurgical literature.",0
2019,Artificial Intelligence for the Otolaryngologist: A State of the Art Review.,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a state of the art review of artificial intelligence (AI), including its subfields of machine learning and natural language processing, as  it applies to otolaryngology and to discuss current applications, future impact,  and limitations of these technologies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Medline search  engines. REVIEW METHODS: A structured search of the current literature was  performed (up to and including September 2018). Search terms related to topics of  AI in otolaryngology were identified and queried to identify relevant articles.  CONCLUSIONS: AI is at the forefront of conversation in academic research and  popular culture. In recent years, it has been touted for its potential to  revolutionize health care delivery. Yet, to date, it has made few contributions  to actual medical practice or patient care. Future adoption of AI technologies in  otolaryngology practice may be hindered by misconceptions of what AI is and a  fear that machine errors may compromise patient care. However, with potential  clinical and economic benefits, it is vital for otolaryngologists to understand  the principles and scope of AI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In the coming years,  AI is likely to have a major impact on biomedical research and the practice of  medicine. Otolaryngologists are key stakeholders in the development and clinical  integration of meaningful AI technologies that will improve patient care.  High-quality data collection is essential for the development of AI technologies,  and otolaryngologists should seek opportunities to collaborate with data  scientists to guide them toward the most impactful clinical questions.",0
2019,Reliability of Americleft Yardstick Nasolabial Appearance Assessment With/Without Basal View for Japanese Children With Unilateral Complete Cleft Lip and Palate.,The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association,"OBJECTIVE: There is debate on the reliability of the Americleft Yardstick (AY) global nasolabial appearance assessment method. The objective was to analyze the  effect of the additional basal view (BV) feature on the reliability of the AY  method for Japanese children with complete cleft lip and palate (CUCLP). DESIGN:  Blind retrospective analysis of clinical records on 43 patients (5- to  7-year-old) with nonsyndromic CUCLP who underwent primary lip repair from 2005 to  2011. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Color pictures published in AY and Rubin's studies  were used as reference pictures. Patients' photographs were cropped and rated on  a 5-point scale for the vermilion border (VB), nasolabial frontal (NLF), and  nasolabial profile (NLP) according to AY with/without BV assessment by Rubin's  methods. Rating was performed twice by 3 oral surgeons. Intra- and inter-rater  reliabilities were analyzed using weighted κ, and correlations between BV and  other features were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall average assessment scores were  2.742 (0.573) with AY and 2.702 (0.489) with AY+BV methods (P = .728). Average  intra-rater reliabilities were 0.605 and 0.611 and average inter-rater  reliabilities were 0.525 and 0.48 with AY and AY+BV, respectively. Inter-rater  reliability was the lowest for NLP. ρ scores between BV versus VB, NLF, and NLP  were 0.025, 0.659, and 0.092, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Present study  demonstrates moderate intra- and inter-rater reliabilities obtained with the AY  assessment method for Japanese children with CUCLP. Nasolabial profile standard  ambiguity may lead to the poor reliability of AY assessment. Addition of the BV  feature does not improve overall reliability.",0
2018,Unique Clinical Language Patterns Among Expert Vestibular Providers Can Predict Vestibular Diagnoses.,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology","OBJECTIVE: To identify novel language usage by expert providers predictive of specific vestibular conditions. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review and  natural language processing. Level IV. SETTING: Tertiary referral center.  PATIENTS: Patients seen for vestibular complaint. INTERVENTION(S): Natural  language processing and machine learning analyses of semantic and syntactic  patterns in clinical documentation from vestibular patients. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURE: Accuracy of Naïve Bayes predictive models correlating language usage  with clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: Natural language analyses on 866  physician-generated histories from vestibular patients found 3,286 unique  examples of language usage of which 614 were used 10 or greater times. The top 15  semantic types represented only 11% of all Unified Medical Language System  semantic types but covered 86% of language used in vestibular patient histories.  Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms on a subset of 255 notes representing  benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular migraine, anxiety-related  dizziness and central dizziness generated strong predictive models showing an  average sensitivity rate of 93.4% and a specificity rate of 98.2%. A binary model  for assessing whether a subject had a specific diagnosis or not had an average  AUC for the receiver operating characteristic curves of .995 across all  conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that expert providers utilize  unique language patterns in vestibular notes that are highly conserved. These  patterns have strong predictive power toward specific vestibular diagnoses. Such  language elements can provide a simple vocabulary to aid nonexpert providers in  formulating a differential diagnosis. They can also be incorporated into clinical  decision support systems to facilitate accurate vestibular diagnosis in  ambulatory settings.",1
2018,Outcome of endoscopic trans-ethmosphenoid optic canal decompression for indirect traumatic optic neuropathy in children.,BMC ophthalmology,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the safety and outcomes of endoscopic trans-ethmosphenoid optic canal decompression (ETOCD) for children with indirect traumatic optic  neuropathy (ITON). METHODS: From July 1st, 2008 to July 1st, 2015, 62 children  diagnosed with ITON who underwent ETOCD were reviewed. Main outcome measure was  improvement in visual acuity after treatment. RESULTS: Altogether 62 children (62  eyes) with a mean age of 11.26 ± 4.14 years were included. Thirty-three (53.2%)  of them had residual vision before surgery while 29 (46.8%) had no light  perception (NLP). The overall visual acuity improvement rate after surgery was  54.84%. The improvement rate of patients with residual vision (69.70%) was  significant higher than that of patients with no light perception (NLP) (37.9%)  (P = 0.012). However, no significant difference was shown among patients with  different residual vision (P = 0.630). Presence of orbital and/ or optic canal  fracture and hemorrhage within the post-ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinus resulted in  poor postoperative visual acuity, duration of presenting complaints did not  affect final visual acuity or did not effect outcomes. Intervention performed in  children presenting even after 7 days from the injury did not influence the final  visual outcome. Three patients developed cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea and one  encountered cavernous sinus hemorrhage during surgery. No other severe  complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Children with residual vision had better  postoperative visual prognosis and benefited more from ETOCD than children with  NLP. Intervention performed in children presenting even after 7 days from the  injury did not influence the final visual outcome, however, this needs to be  reassessed in children presenting long after the injury.Treatment should still be  recommended even for cases of delayed presentation to hospital.",0
2017,[A 212 cases analysis of treatment for traumatic optic neuropathy by nasal endoscopic opticnerve decompression].,Lin chuang er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Journal of clinical otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,"Objective:To explore the clinical features and therapeutic efficacy of nasal endoscopic optic nerve decompression for traumatic optic neuropathy  (TON)treatment.Method:Two hundred and twelve cases (217 eyes) with TON were  retrospectively analyzed in our study, who were treated with nasal endoscopic  optic nerve decompression in our institution from 1999 to 2016. χ ² -test was  used to explore the potential prognostic factors on visual acuity.Result:All  patients were followed up from 6 months to 2 years postoperatively, and the  effective rate was 54.38%(118/217).In the 166 eyes with no light perception  (NLP), the effective rate was 46.39% (77/166), while in the 51 eyes with light  perception (LP), the effective rate was 80.39% (41/51).The therapeutic efficacy  of patients with LP or above LP was better than that of NLP, and the difference  was statistically significant(χ ²=18.186, P< 0.01).Moreover, the therapeutic  efficacy of patients without an optic canal fracture was better than that with an  optic canal fracture，and the difference had statistical significance (χ ²=10.096,  P<0.01).Conclusion:The efficacy of nasal endoscopic optic nerve decompression on  TON was positive, and even for the patients with NLP or a long history also  should have a try.",0
2019,Trends in Singing Voice Research: An Innovative Approach.,Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to trace and describe research patterns in singing voice, to compare the amount of published research over time,  to identify journals that published most papers on ""singing voice,"" and to  establish the most frequent research topics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study  uses qualitative and quantitative approaches through descriptive statistics, text  mining, and clustering. The authors conducted a search to identify scientific  papers. The titles and abstracts were analyzed regarding word frequency and  relations between them, through hierarchical cluster analysis and co-occurrence  networks. The frequency of journals was calculated, as well as the amount of  papers across time. RESULTS: Since 1949, 754 papers were published and an  increase was noticed. Even though 162 journals were identified by the authors,  the Journal of Voice holds the majority of papers, in every analyzed period. An  evolution of studied topics is described. Up to 2010, the main theme was  professional singers, especially classical and opera interpreters. Since then,  voice quality and the effects of training gathered more attention. CONCLUSIONS:  The growing interest in singing has been conspicuous since the first indexed  paper. However, it has been slightly slowing down. Until 2010, great importance  was given to the voice quality of singers and their occupational demands.  Acoustic analysis was widely used to study the effects of training. Since 2010,  the concern with functionality is increasing, rather than the organic voice  structures. Musical perception studies have been a trend, as well as the use of  electroglottography.",0
2017,Clinical features of visual disturbances secondary to isolated sphenoid sinus inflammatory diseases.,BMC ophthalmology,"BACKGROUND: Visual disturbances associated with isolated sphenoid sinus inflammatory diseases (ISSIDs) are easily misdiagnosed due to the nonspecific  symptoms and undetectable anatomical location. The main objective of this  retrospective case series is to investigate the clinical features of visual  disturbances secondary to ISSIDs. METHODS: Clinical data of 23 patients with  unilateral or bilateral visual disturbances secondary to ISSIDs from 2004 to 2014  with new symptoms were collected. Collected data including symptoms, signs,  neuroimaging and pathologic diagnosis were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 14 males  and 9 females, and their ages ranged from 31 to 83 years. Fifteen patients  suffered blurred vision and 11 patients suffered binocular double vision,  including 3 patients who had unilateral visual changes and diplopia  simultaneously. Headache was observed in 18 patients, and orbit pain/ocular pain  in 8 patients. Other presenting symptoms included ptosis (4 patients) and  proptosis (1 patient). Only 5 patients had nasal complaints. The corrected visual  acuities were between NLP to 20/20. Patients with diplopia included 5 with  unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and 6 with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. All  patients performed orbital/sinus/brain radiologic examination and found  responsible lesions in sphenoid sinus. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus  surgery, and 9 patients were found to suffer sphenoid mucocele, 9 with fungal  sinusitis, and 5 with sphenoid sinusitis. Visual disturbances improved in 6  patients, and all the patients with diplopia had a postoperative recovery.  CONCLUSION: Visual disturbances resulting from ISSIDs are relatively uncommon,  but it is crucial that the patient with new vision loss or diplopia and  persistent headache or orbit pain be evaluated for the possibility of ISSIDs  especially before corticosteroid administration.",0
2018,eRAM: encyclopedia of rare disease annotations for precision medicine.,Nucleic acids research,"Rare diseases affect over a hundred million people worldwide, most of these patients are not accurately diagnosed and effectively treated. The limited  knowledge of rare diseases forms the biggest obstacle for improving their  treatment. Detailed clinical phenotyping is considered as a keystone of  deciphering genes and realizing the precision medicine for rare diseases. Here,  we preset a standardized system for various types of rare diseases, called  encyclopedia of Rare disease Annotations for Precision Medicine (eRAM). eRAM was  built by text-mining nearly 10 million scientific publications and electronic  medical records, and integrating various data in existing recognized databases  (such as Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), Human Phenotype Ontology,  Orphanet, OMIM, GWAS). eRAM systematically incorporates currently available data  on clinical manifestations and molecular mechanisms of rare diseases and uncovers  many novel associations among diseases. eRAM provides enriched annotations for 15  942 rare diseases, yielding 6147 human disease related phenotype terms, 31 661  mammalians phenotype terms, 10,202 symptoms from UMLS, 18 815 genes and 92 580  genotypes. eRAM can not only provide information about rare disease mechanism but  also facilitate clinicians to make accurate diagnostic and therapeutic decisions  towards rare diseases. eRAM can be freely accessed at http://www.unimd.org/eram/.",0
2017,Upper gastrointestinal complications following ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation.,Neurogastroenterology and motility,"BACKGROUND: Following ablation therapy for cardiac arrhythmias, patients may develop upper gastrointestinal (UGI) symptoms. The vagus nerve is close to the  atria and may be affected by ablating energy. AIM: To identify structural or  functional complications in UGI tract following ablation for atrial fibrillation  (AF) and clinical outcomes and association with vagal dysfunction. METHODS: Using  natural language processing of electronic medical records and an AF ablation  database of 5380 patients treated during 17 years, we identified 40 patients with  UGI complications. We evaluated vagal dysfunction by electrocardiogram (ECG)  showing lack of sinus arrhythmia (variation in R-R interval by ≥120 milliseconds,  in presence of normal sinus P waves and constant P-R interval). KEY RESULTS:  Among 40 patients: (A) eight had structural GI complications confirmed by  diagnostic tests: seven with esophageal ulcer/erosions and no signs of UGI  bleeding and one developed esophagopericardial fistula (and survived with  treatment); (B) 15 had functional UGI complications confirmed by objective  motility tests. Nine had newly developed symptoms and six had aggravated  symptoms; and (C) the remaining 17 had GI symptoms without relevant diagnostic  results. Most UGI issues resolved spontaneously or with conservative treatment.  However, 2 died several weeks after ablation procedure; cause of death was  suspected atrioesophageal fistula or esophageal rupture. Vagal dysfunction  persisted for 3 months in 13 and was transient in 8. CONCLUSIONS/INFERENCES:  Although most GI issues resolved spontaneously, there should be a high index of  clinical suspicion in patients with persistent symptoms. Vagal dysfunction may  serve as a marker of more extensive tissue damage.",0
2017,Using Social Listening Data to Monitor Misuse and Nonmedical Use of Bupropion: A Content Analysis.,JMIR public health and surveillance,"BACKGROUND: The nonmedical use of pharmaceutical products has become a significant public health concern. Traditionally, the evaluation of nonmedical  use has focused on controlled substances with addiction risk. Currently, there is  no effective means of evaluating the nonmedical use of noncontrolled  antidepressants. OBJECTIVE: Social listening, in the context of public health  sometimes called infodemiology or infoveillance, is the process of identifying  and assessing what is being said about a company, product, brand, or individual,  within forms of electronic interactive media. The objectives of this study were  (1) to determine whether content analysis of social listening data could be  utilized to identify posts discussing potential misuse or nonmedical use of  bupropion and two comparators, amitriptyline and venlafaxine, and (2) to describe  and characterize these posts. METHODS: Social listening was performed on all  publicly available posts cumulative through July 29, 2015, from two  harm-reduction Web forums, Bluelight and Opiophile, which mentioned the study  drugs. The acquired data were stripped of personally identifiable identification  (PII). A set of generic, brand, and vernacular product names was used to identify  product references in posts. Posts were obtained using natural language  processing tools to identify vernacular references to drug misuse-related  Preferred Terms from the English Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) version 18 terminology. Posts were reviewed manually by coders, who  extracted relevant details. RESULTS: A total of 7756 references to at least one  of the study antidepressants were identified within posts gathered for this  study. Of these posts, 668 (8.61%, 668/7756) referenced misuse or nonmedical use  of the drug, with bupropion accounting for 438 (65.6%, 438/668). Of the 668  posts, nonmedical use was discouraged by 40.6% (178/438), 22% (22/100), and 18.5%  (24/130) and encouraged by 12.3% (54/438), 10% (10/100), and 10.8% (14/130) for  bupropion, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine, respectively. The most commonly  reported desired effects were similar to stimulants with bupropion, sedatives  with amitriptyline, and dissociatives with venlafaxine. The nasal route of  administration was most frequently reported for bupropion, whereas the oral route  was most frequently reported for amitriptyline and venlafaxine. Bupropion and  venlafaxine were most commonly procured from health care providers, whereas  amitriptyline was most commonly obtained or stolen from a third party. The Fleiss  kappa for interrater agreement among 20 items with 7 categorical response options  evaluated by all 11 raters was 0.448 (95% CI 0.421-0.457). CONCLUSIONS: Social  listening, conducted in collaboration with harm-reduction Web forums, offers a  valuable new data source that can be used for monitoring nonmedical use of  antidepressants. Additional work on the capabilities of social listening will  help further delineate the benefits and limitations of this rapidly evolving data  source.",0
2017,Detection of clinically important colorectal surgical site infection using Bayesian network.,The Journal of surgical research,"BACKGROUND: Despite extensive efforts to monitor and prevent surgical site infections (SSIs), real-time surveillance of clinical practice has been sparse  and expensive or nonexistent. However, natural language processing (NLP) and  machine learning (i.e., Bayesian network analysis) may provide the methodology  necessary to approach this issue in a new way. We investigated the ability to  identify SSIs after colorectal surgery (CRS) through an automated detection  system using a Bayesian network. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent  CRS from 2010 to 2012 and were captured in our institutional American College of  Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) comprised our  cohort. A Bayesian network was applied to detect SSIs using risk factors from  ACS-NSQIP data and keywords extracted from clinical notes by NLP. Two surgeons  provided expertise informing the Bayesian network to identify clinically  meaningful SSIs (CM-SSIs) occurring within 30 d after surgery. RESULTS: We used  data from 751 CRS cases experiencing 67 (8.9%) SSIs and 78 (10.4%) CM-SSIs. Our  Bayesian network detected ACS-NSQIP-captured SSIs with a receiver operating  characteristic area under the curve of 0.827, but this value increased to 0.892  when using surgeon-identified CM-SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: A Bayesian network coupled  with NLP has the potential to be used in real-time SSI surveillance. Moreover,  surgeons identified CM-SSI not captured under current NSQIP definitions. Future  efforts to expand CM-SSI identification may lead to improved and potentially  automated approaches to survey for postoperative SSI in clinical practice.",0
2016,Characteristics of chronic megacolon among patients diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.,United European gastroenterology journal,"BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal symptoms are frequent in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B and may be related to megacolon. OBJECTIVE: The objective of  this article is to review the clinical features of patients with MEN 2B,  particularly megacolon. METHODS: We used natural language processing of  electronic medical records of Mayo Clinic patients over 20 years: Eight patients  with definite MEN 2B were identified; of these, four had megacolon. From these  patients' records, three others with paper medical records were identified  through familial association. We used a standard data sheet to identify features  of the disease with particular emphasis on megacolon. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients  identified with MEN 2B, seven (63%) had megacolon, typically presenting with  constipation in infancy or megacolon in childhood. In addition, three patients  had esophageal manifestations (two achalasia and one Zenker's diverticulum).  Megacolon often required surgical intervention for intractable constipation,  abdominal distension and discomfort. Histopathological features of resected colon  revealed enteric and extrinsic nerve hyperplasia and ganglioneuromas of the  submucosal and myenteric plexuses. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with MEN 2B, 63%  had megacolon. Significant esophageal motor disorders in MEN 2B may affect ∼25%  of patients. Any presentation with megacolon should trigger a search for MEN 2B  in order to identify the potentially fatal endocrine tumors.",0
2017,Transoral laser microsurgery for managing laryngeal stenosis after reconstructive partial laryngectomies.,The Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To retrospectively analyze our experience of transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for treating postoperative laryngeal obstruction (POLO)  after supracricoid and supratracheal laryngectomy (open partial horizontal  laryngectomy [OPHL]) types 2 and 3, and to investigate potential relationships  between patients' clinical features and their functional outcomes. STUDY DESIGN:  A retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The prognostic influence of clinical and  surgical parameters on functional outcomes was investigated in a univariate  statistical setting in terms of decannulation rate (DR), time to tracheostomy  closure (TTC), and number of laser procedures required (NLP). RESULTS: OPHL type  2 was associated with a better functional outcome than OPHL type 3 in terms of  DR, TTC, and NLP (P = .03, P = .02, and P = .02, respectively). Annular and  semicircumferential stenoses developed more frequently after OPHL type 3, and  were particularly difficult to manage with TLM. Fixation of the residual  arytenoid was a negative prognostic factor in terms of functional outcome in  terms of DR, TTC, and NLP (P = .0002, P = .08, and P = .08, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS: There is no standardized laser treatment for POLO; it must be  tailored to individual patients. Identifying prognostic factors influencing  functional outcome could help surgeons to earmark patients less likely to benefit  from TLM for the treatment of POLO, and enable an adequate preoperative  counseling, given the high probability of repeat postoperative TLM procedures.

2016,Toward Signaling-Driven Biomarkers Immune to Normal Tissue Contamination.,Cancer informatics,"The goal of this study was to discover a minimally invasive pathway-specific biomarker that is immune to normal cell mRNA contamination for diagnosing head  and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using Elsevier's MedScan natural  language processing component of the Pathway Studio software and the TRANSFAC  database, we produced a curated set of genes regulated by the signaling networks  driving the development of HNSCC. The network and its gene targets provided prior  probabilities for gene expression, which guided our CoGAPS matrix factorization  algorithm to isolate patterns related to HNSCC signaling activity from a  microarray-based study. Using patterns that distinguished normal from tumor  samples, we identified a reduced set of genes to analyze with Top Scoring Pair in  order to produce a potential biomarker for HNSCC. Our proposed biomarker  comprises targets of the transcription factor (TF) HIF1A and the FOXO family of  TFs coupled with genes that show remarkable stability across all normal tissues.  Based on validation with novel data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), measured  by RNAseq, and bootstrap sampling, the biomarker for normal vs. tumor has an  accuracy of 0.77, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.54, and an area under  the curve (AUC) of 0.82.",1
2016,Timing of endoscopic surgical decompression in traumatic optic neuropathy: a systematic review of the literature.,International forum of allergy & rhinology,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) represents a rare but devastating complication of closed head injuries. No accepted guidelines are available for  medical and surgical management algorithms. A systematic review of the literature  was performed to determine the optimal timing and candidacy for endoscopic  surgical intervention. METHODS: A systematic review of multiple databases was  performed including Medline-Ovid, EMBASE, and PubMed. Data was extracted and  patients stratified based on surgical delay from trauma (≤3 days, >3 days, ≤7  days, or >7 days) as well as preoperative and postoperative vision testing (no  light perception [NLP]; light perception [LP]; hand motion [HM]; or finger  counting [FC] or better). RESULTS: The literature review identified 24 studies  meeting inclusion criteria. In the group of patients receiving surgery ≤3 days  after the antecedent event, 57% (105/183) had visual improvement, whereas in the  >7-days group 51% (145/283) of patients improved. In those with NLP  preoperatively, 41% (172/411) saw improvement, whereas those with LP (89%), HM  (93%), or FC (85%) fared better. CONCLUSION: The literature suggests that  surgical intervention for TON is indicated despite delayed presentation, and is a  better choice than no intervention at all. Patients with complete blindness on  presentation (NLP) tend to have a poorer surgical outcome.",0
2015,Prognostic Value of Ocular Trauma Scores in Patients With Combined Open Globe Injuries and Facial Fractures.,American journal of ophthalmology,"PURPOSE: To assess the prognostic value of the Ocular Trauma Score in patients with combined open globe injuries and facial fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective  cohort study. METHODS: A comprehensive chart review was conducted on 25 patients  (28 eyes) identified from the Elmhurst City Hospital Trauma Registry between  January 1, 2000 and June 30, 2012. Elmhurst City Hospital is a level 1 trauma  center located in Elmhurst, New York, USA. RESULTS: Average age was 52 (range  18-88) and patients were predominantly male (84%). The majority of patients had  an Ocular Trauma Score of 1 (87.5%), and of these patients, 76% and 14% had final  visual acuities of no light perception (NLP) and light perception/hand motion  (LP/HM), respectively. These corresponded to 74% and 15% predicted by the  original Ocular Trauma Score guidelines (100% sensitive and 100% specific).  Ocular Trauma Score of 1 was associated with zone 3 eye wound location (P = .02).  Independent of Ocular Trauma Score, initial visual acuity and frontal bone  fractures were predictive of NLP (P = .006 and P = .047). Nonblindness was  associated with nasal bone fractures (P = .047). CONCLUSION: This study validates  the use of the Ocular Trauma Score in patients with combined facial fracture and  open globe injury. The presence of facial fractures does not appear to influence  visual prognosis for open globe injuries with an Ocular Trauma Score of 1. In the  absence of data to calculate a full Ocular Trauma Score, initial visual acuity  was the strongest predictor of final visual outcome.",0
2014,Accuracy of phenotyping chronic rhinosinusitis in the electronic health record.,American journal of rhinology & allergy,"BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is prevalent, morbid, and poorly understood. Extraction of electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with  CRS may facilitate research on CRS. However, the accuracy of using structured  billing codes for EHR-driven phenotyping of CRS is unknown. We sought to  accurately identify CRS cases and controls using EHR data and to determine the  accuracy of structured billing codes for identifying patients with CRS. METHODS:  We developed and validated distinct algorithms to identify patients with CRS and  controls using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)  and Current Procedural Terminology codes. We used blinded clinician chart review  as the reference standard to evaluate algorithm and billing code accuracy.  RESULTS: Our initial control algorithm achieved a control positive predictive  value (PPV) of 100% (i.e., negative predictive value of 100% for CRS). Our  initial algorithm for CRS cases relied exclusively on billing codes and had a low  case PPV (54%). Notably, ICD-9 code 471.x was associated with a case PPV of 85%,  whereas the case PPV of ICD-9 code 473.x was only 34%. After multiple algorithm  iterations, we increased the case PPV of our final algorithm to 91% by adding  several requirements, e.g., that ICD-9 codes occur with 1 or more evaluations by  a CRS specialist to enhance availability of objective clinical data for  accurately phenotyping CRS. CONCLUSION: These algorithms are an important first  step to identify patients with CRS, and may facilitate EHR-based research on CRS  pathogenesis, morbidity, and management. Exclusive use of coded data for  phenotyping CRS has limited accuracy, especially because CRS symptomatology  overlaps with that of other illnesses. Incorporating natural language processing  (e.g., to evaluate results of nasal endoscopy or sinus computed tomography) into  future work may increase algorithm accuracy and identify patients whose disease  status may not be ascertained by only using billing codes.",0
2014,[Systematic analysis of the readability of patient information on websites of German nonuniversity ENT hospitals].,HNO,"BACKGROUND: Besides their function as one of the main contact points, websites of hospitals serve as medical information portals. All patients should be able to  understand medical information texts; regardless of their literacy skills and  educational level. Online texts should thus have an appropriate structure to ease  their comprehension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient information texts on every  German nonuniversity ENT hospital website (n = 125) were systematically analysed.  For ten different ENT topics a representative medical information text was  extracted from each website. Using objective text parameters and five established  readability indices, the texts were analysed in terms of their readability and  structure. Furthermore, we stratified the analysis in relation to the hospital  organisation system and geographical region in Germany. RESULTS: Texts from 142  internet sites could be used for the definite analysis. On average, texts  consisted of 15 sentences and 237 words. Readability indices congruously showed  that the analysed texts could generally only be understood by a well-educated or  even academic reader. CONCLUSION: The majority of patient information texts on  German hospital websites are difficult to understand for most patients. In order  to fulfil their goal of adequately informing the general population about  disease, therapeutic options and the particular focal points of the clinic, a  revision of most medical texts on the websites of German ENT hospitals is  recommended.",0
2013,"Germline genetic contributions to risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, Barrett's esophagus, and gastroesophageal reflux.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is an increasingly common cancer with poor survival. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the main precursor to EA, and every  year 0.12% to 0.5% of BE patients progress to EA. BE typically arises on a  background of chronic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), one of the risk factors for  EA. METHODS: We used genome-wide association data to investigate the genetic  architecture underlying GERD, BE, and EA. We applied a method to estimate the  variance explained (array heritability, h(2)g) and the genetic correlation (rg)  between GERD, BE, and EA by considering all single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) simultaneously. We also estimated the polygenic overlap between GERD, BE,  and EA using a prediction approach. All tests were two-sided, except in the case  of variance-explained estimation where one-sided tests were used. RESULTS: We  estimated a statistically significant genetic variance explained for BE (h(2)g =  35%; standard error [SE] = 6%; one-sided P = 1 × 10(-9)) and for EA (h(2)g = 25  %; SE = 5%; one-sided P = 2 × 10(-7)). The genetic correlation between BE and EA  was found to be high (rg = 1.0; SE = 0.37). We also estimated a statistically  significant polygenic overlap between BE and EA (one-sided P = 1 × 10(-6)), which  suggests, together with the high genetic correlation, that shared genes underlie  the development of BE and EA. Conversely, no statistically significant results  were obtained for GERD. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that risk to BE and EA  is influenced by many germline genetic variants of small effect and that shared  polygenic effects contribute to risk of these two diseases.",0
2013,Vision loss after maxillary artery embolization secondary to compressive optic neuropathy.,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,"The authors report a case of no light perception (NLP) vision in a patient with sinonasal melanoma after maxillary artery embolization secondary to presumptive  compressive optic neuropathy. Two reports of NLP vision occurring after maxillary  artery embolization are reported in the literature,, both occurring secondary to  collateral blood flow to the ophthalmic artery resulting in central retinal  artery occlusion. In the current case report, the presumed mechanism of vision  loss is secondary to compressive optic neuropathy from local edema occurring  after maxillary artery embolization.",0
2013,Ontology for heart rate turbulence domain from the conceptual model of SNOMED-CT.,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"Electronic health record (EHR) automates the clinician workflow, allowing evidence-based decision support and quality management. We aimed to start a  framework for domain standardization of cardiovascular risk stratification into  the EHR, including risk indices whose calculation involves ECG signal processing.  We propose the use of biomedical ontologies completely based on the conceptual  model of SNOMED-CT, which allows us to implement our domain in the EHR. In this  setting, the present study focused on the heart rate turbulence (HRT) domain,  according to its concise guidelines and clear procedures for parameter  calculations. We used 289 concepts from SNOMED-CT, and generated 19 local  extensions (new concepts) for the HRT specific concepts not present in the  current version of SNOMED-CT. New concepts included averaged and individual  ventricular premature complex tachograms, initial sinus acceleration for  turbulence onset, or sinusal oscillation for turbulence slope. Two representative  use studies were implemented: first, a prototype was inserted in the hospital  information system for supporting HRT recordings and their simple follow up by  medical societies; second, an advanced support for a prospective scientific  research, involving standard and emergent signal processing algorithms in the HRT  indices, was generated and then tested in an example database of 27 Holter  patients. Concepts of the proposed HRT ontology are publicly available through a  terminology server, hence their use in any information system will be  straightforward due to the interoperability provided by SNOMED-CT.",0
2011,[Clinical research on nasal endoscopic surgery for rhinogenous optic function damage].,Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the surgical treatment of rhinogenous optic function damage (ROFD) through transnasal endoscopic approach. METHODS: Twenty-three patients (25  eyes) with ROFD were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were operated on  through transnasal endoscopic approach, and 9 patients underwent endoscopic optic  nerve decompression. RESULTS: Four patients had bilateral pansinusitis, 6  patients had unilateral posterior ethmoidal sinusitis and sphenoiditis. One  patient had frontal and ethmoidal sinusitis. Five patients had fungal sinusitis  occurred in the sphenoid sinus and unilateral posterior ethmoid sinus. Two  patients had unilateral pyocyst and cyst of the sphenoid and ethmoid sinus. The  preoperative visual acuity preoperative were as follows: 2 patients (2 eyes) no  light perception (NLP), 6 patients (7 eyes) hand movement (HM), 7 patients (7  eyes) fingers counting (FC) less than 20 cm and 8 patients (9 eyes) were vision  impaired in different degree. One patient (1 eye) was ophthalmoptosis, direct and  indirect light reflex vanished. Three patients (3 eyes) diplopia, 2 patients (2  eyes) abduction paralysis, 3 patients (3 eyes) defect of visual field. One  patient ptosis of upper lid. The visual acuity postoperative: 2 eyes failed, 10  eyes cured;13 eyes improved from HM or FC to FC (30-60 cm). CONCLUSIONS: The  endoscopic sinus surgery combined with appropriate medical therapy are effective  to ROFD. Patients who suffered from severe visual damage and either unresponsive  or intolerant to medical treatment should be administrated endoscopic sinus  surgery including endoscopic optic nerve decompression.",0
2012,Bleb-associated endophthalmitis in a Chinese population (2003-2010): clinical characteristics and visual outcome.,European journal of ophthalmology,"PURPOSE: To analyze the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with bleb-associated endophthalmitis (BAE) in a Chinese population.  METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated for BAE between January 2003  and December 2010 in a single institution was performed. Data on visual acuity  (VA), clinical characteristics, causative organisms, and treatment outcomes were  collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one eyes from 31 patients with BAE were  identified during the study period. Primary open-angle glaucoma was the most  common type of glaucoma in this series (18 eyes, 58.1%). The time between  glaucoma filtering surgery and diagnosis of endophthalmitis ranged from 18 days  to 32 years, with a mean of 6.95 ± 8.22 years. Nine eyes (32.1%) were culture  positive, and the most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus species  (6/9, 66.7%). Best-corrected VA at 12 months after treatment ranged from 20/30 to  no light perception (NLP). Twelve (38.7%) eyes achieved VA of 20/400 or better,  and 7 (22.6%) eyes had NLP. In patients undergoing initial tap-and-inject  treatment, the eyes with presenting VA of finger count or better were associated  with a higher treatment success rate (87.5%) than those of hand movement (33.3%)  or light perception or NLP (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Primary open-angle glaucoma was  the most common type of glaucoma, and Staphylococcus species was the most common  causative organism in this case series of BAE. Despite prompt treatment with  appropriate intravitreal antibiotics, BAE still carries a poor visual prognosis.",0
2010,Novel approaches to global mining of aberrantly methylated promoter sites in squamous head and neck cancer.,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,"OBJECTIVE: Promoter hypermethylation is emerging as a promising molecular strategy for early detection of cancer. We examined promoter methylation status  of 1143 cancer-associated genes to perform a global but unbiased inspection of  methylated regions in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). STUDY  DESIGN: Laboratory-based study. SETTING: Integrated health care system. SUBJECTS  AND METHODS: Five samples, two frozen primary HNSCC biopsies and three HNSCC cell  lines, were examined. Whole genomic DNA was interrogated using a combination of  DNA immunoprecipitation (IP) and Affymetrix whole-genome tiling arrays. RESULTS:  Of the 1143 unique cancer genes on the array, 265 were recorded across five  samples. Of the 265 genes, 55 were present in all five samples, and 36 were  common to four of five samples, 46 to three of five, 56 to two of five, and 72 to  one of five samples. Hypermethylated genes in the five samples were  cross-examined against those in PubMeth, a cancer methylation database combining  text mining and expert annotation (http://www.pubmeth.org). Of the 441 genes in  PubMeth, only 33 are referenced to HNSCC. We matched 34 genes in our samples to  the 441 genes in the PubMeth database. Of the 34 genes, eight are reported in  PubMeth as HNSCC associated. CONCLUSION: This pilot study examined the  contribution of global DNA hypermethylation to the pathogenesis of HNSCC. The  whole-genome methylation approach indicated 231 new genes with methylated  promoter regions not yet reported in HNSCC. Examination of this comprehensive  gene panel in a larger HNSCC cohort should advance selection of HNSCC-specific  candidate genes for further validation as biomarkers in HNSCC.",0
2010,Separation of biological proteins by liquid chromatography.,Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society,"After the success of human genome project, proteome is a new emerging field of biochemistry as it provides the knowledge of enzymes (proteins) interactions with  different body organs and medicines administrated into human body. Therefore, the  study of proteomics is very important for the development of new and effective  drugs to control many lethal diseases. In proteomics study, analyses of proteome  is essential and significant from the pathological point of views, i.e., in  several serious diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and aging, heart  diseases and also for plant biology. The separation and identification of  proteomics is a challenging job due to their complex structures and closely  related physico-chemical behaviors. However, the recent advances in liquid  chromatography make this job easy. Various kinds of liquid chromatography, along  with different detectors and optimization strategies, have been discussed in this  article. Besides, attempts have been made to include chirality concept in  proteomics for understanding mechanism and medication of various disease  controlled by different body proteins.",0
2009,Oxidative stress and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans as mediated by SKN-1.,Aging cell,"Oxidative stress has been hypothesized to play a role in normal aging. The response to oxidative stress is regulated by the SKN-1 transcription factor,  which also is necessary for intestinal development in Caenorhabditis elegans.  Almost a thousand genes including the antioxidant and heat-shock responses, as  well as genes responsible for xenobiotic detoxification were induced by the  oxidative stress which was found using transcriptome analysis. There were also  392 down-regulated genes including many involved in metabolic homeostasis,  organismal development, and reproduction. Many of these oxidative stress-induced  transcriptional changes are dependent on SKN-1 action; the induction of the  heat-shock response is not. When RNAi to inhibit genes was used, most had no  effect on either resistance to oxidative stress or longevity; however two  SKN-1-dependent genes, nlp-7 and cup-4, that were up-regulated by oxidative  stress were found to be required for resistance to oxidative stress and for  normal lifespan. nlp-7 encodes a neuropeptide-like protein, expressed in neurons,  while cup-4 encodes a coelomocyte-specific, ligand-gated ion channel. RNAi of  nlp-7 or cup-4 increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and reduced lifespan.  Among down-regulated genes, only inhibition of ent-1, a nucleoside transporter,  led to increased resistance to oxidative stress; inhibition had no effect on  lifespan. In contrast, RNAi of nhx-2, a Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, extended lifespan  significantly without affecting sensitivity to oxidative stress. These findings  showed that a transcriptional shift from growth and maintenance towards the  activation of cellular defense mechanisms was caused by the oxidative stress;  many of these transcriptional alterations are SKN-1 dependent.",0
2007,Anticipation-based temporal sequences learning in hierarchical structure.,IEEE transactions on neural networks,"Temporal sequence learning is one of the most critical components for human intelligence. In this paper, a novel hierarchical structure for complex temporal  sequence learning is proposed. Hierarchical organization, a prediction mechanism,  and one-shot learning characterize the model. In the lowest level of the  hierarchy, we use a modified Hebbian learning mechanism for pattern recognition.  Our model employs both active 0 and active 1 sensory inputs. A winner-take-all  (WTA) mechanism is used to select active neurons that become the input for  sequence learning at higher hierarchical levels. Prediction is an essential  element of our temporal sequence learning model. By correct prediction, the  machine indicates it knows the current sequence and does not require additional  learning. When the prediction is incorrect, one-shot learning is executed and the  machine learns the new input sequence as soon as the sequence is completed. A  four-level hierarchical structure that isolates letters, words, sentences, and  strophes is used in this paper to illustrate the model.",0
2006,Cavernous sinus/orbital apex syndrome associated with indwelling orbital catheter use.,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,"A 46-year-old man with a history of right orbital fractures and blindness underwent simultaneous fracture repair and enucleation with orbital implantation.  During surgery, an orbital catheter was placed for administering local anesthesia  to control postoperative pain. After administration of local anesthesia through  the catheter on postoperative day 1, the patient had development of a complete  ptosis, total ophthalmoplegia, mydriasis, vision loss from 20/20 to NLP, and  hypesthesia of the V1 and V2 trigeminal nerve distribution. Intraocular pressures  and dilated funduscopic examination were normal. There was no evidence of central  nervous system effects or respiratory depression. After 4 hours of observation,  the vision, sensation, motility, ptosis, and pupil response all returned to  normal. Although rare, contralateral cavernous sinus/orbital apex syndrome may  occur with indwelling orbital catheter administration of local anesthetic in an  orbit with fractures.",0
2006,[Surgical treatment for bilateral traumatic optic neuropathy through intranasal endoscopic approach].,Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,"OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to explore the necessity of nasal endoscopic operation for bilateral traumatic optic neuropathy. METHODS: Four patients with  complete blind resulted from traumatic impairment of bilateral optic nerves were  selected to receive a combined treatment of nasal endoscopic optic nerve  decompression (NEOND) with all-around medication. RESULTS: The vision of all  patients was improved except one who lost vision immediately after trauma. Thirty  days after injury, patient 1 was treated with NEOND, and the vision of left eye  was restored to 1.5, however, the vision of right side was just from light  perception (LP) to hand motion (HM). Patient 2 was treated with NEOND 3 days  after injury, and the vision was improved from LP to 0. 2 in left side, no change  in right eye. The operation of patient 3 was performed 6 days after injury, but  no improvement was observed in both visions. Patient 4 received NEOND 28 days  after injury, the vision was improved in both sides with left eye from NLP to 0.  8 and right eye from NLP to 0.2. CONCLUSIONS: NEOND can be regarded as an  effective treatment for bilateral traumatic blindness, even delayed NEOND may be  effective. Both gradual vision loss and residual vision should be the indications  for an effective NEOND, but immediate blindness after injury might be the index  for poor result of NEOND.",0
2003,A rapid speech synthesizing software on a PDA for Japanese with speech impairments.,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,"We developed a Japanese-language, rapid synthesizing software application for use on a personal digital assistant. It has an unrestricted vocabulary and can  synthesize words and sentences within 3 s. Eight hundred common sentences and  words are preregistered.

The ""European Work Group on the  Genetics of Hearing Impairment,"" which has been working since 1996, proposed a  few questionnaires to collect data regarding the phenotype, ENT findings,  audiological examination findings and other special investigations. In this  study, a computerized patient database application named ""Izmir H.E.A.R version  1.0,"" written in Delphi 4.0 for Windows for recording the patients with hearing  problems, is presented. The application consists of a modular form, including  information about identity, genetic condition, proband query, audiology and  vestibular tests, phenotype, pedigree and special examinations, which allows data  entry on all these issues. It has been developed by using the guidelines of  Hereditary Deafness Epidemiology and Clinical Research (H.E.A.R.) and by the  experience gained within the last 10 years by the authors. The target population  of the program is the ENT clinicians, audiologists, epidemiologists, geneticists  and researchers in the field. The main idea is to create a program serving the  needs of both the daily routine work and research purposes and to distribute this  program to the above-mentioned specialists, to encourage them to try the first  version and to find a standard and/or better way to collect data. For this  reason, the program aims to be multilingual, and the currently available  languages are English, German, Spanish and Turkish.",0

1996,[Microsurgical endonasal decompression in traumatic and neoplastic optic nerve compression].,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,"The therapy of traumatic optic neuropathy remains controversial. Some authors recommend observation and others, the use of megadose corticosteroids or surgical  decompression of the optic nerve. Improvements in visual acuity from no light  perception (NLP) preoperatively to close to normal visual acuities have been  reported after transethmoidal decompression and systemic steroids. The transnasal  microscopic approach offers safe and effective access to the optic canal.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively 15 patients (13 men/2 women) ranging in  age from 17 to 67 years, who were surgically decompressed in the Ear-Nose-Throat  Department between 1989 and 1994, were analyzed. Thirteen patients had  experienced sudden visual loss after trauma; in 2 patients a tumor was diagnosed.  After an initial ophthalmologic examination and CT scans, the patients underwent  transnasal decompression of the optic canal for at least 180 degrees. In the  postoperative period, visual acuity, pupillary reaction, visual field and optic  nerve morphology were monitored. RESULTS: The overall visual results were poor.  In 8 patients with no light perception (NLP) preoperatively, no improvement in  visual acuity was found. Minor improvements were seen with an initial vision of  20/200 or less. Dramatic improvements were found in both patients with rapidly  progressive neoplastic optic nerve compression. No intra- or postoperative  complications were seen. CONCLUSION: In our study we were unable to reproduce the  good visual results of some series. If there is NLP preoperatively, surgical  intervention does not seem to be promising. However, in patients with incurable  tumors transnasal decompression of the optic canal offers a minimally invasive  palliative measure to preserve and restore vision.",0
1996,The expert surgical assistant. An intelligent virtual environment with multimodal input.,Studies in health technology and informatics,"Virtual Reality has made computer interfaces more intuitive but not more intelligent. This paper shows how an expert system can be coupled with multimodal  input in a virtual environment to provide an intelligent simulation tool or  surgical assistant. This is accomplished in three steps. First, voice and  gestural input is interpreted and represented in a common semantic form. Second,  a rule-based expert system is used to infer context and user actions from this  semantic representation. Finally, the inferred user actions are matched against  steps in a surgical procedure to monitor the user's progress and provide  automatic feedback. In addition, the system can respond immediately to multimodal  commands for navigational assistance and/or identification of critical anatomical  structures. To show how these methods are used we present a prototype sinus  surgery interface. The approach described here may easily be extended to a wide  variety of medical and non-medical training applications by making simple changes  to the expert system database and virtual environment models. Successful  implementation of an expert system in both simulated and real surgery has  enormous potential for the surgeon both in training and clinical practice.",0

1985,Facial morphology and vibrissal movement in the golden hamster.,Journal of morphology,"The major cranial vibrissae in the golden hamster can be moved in complex ways that suggest they are served by a finely controlled motor system. Movements are  hypothesized to be the products of differential blood flow and pressure  regulation in the sinus surrounding each vibrissal follicle, contractions of the  striated facial muscles, and elastic rebound in the connective tissues. The  vasculature contributes hydrostatic forces that erect the vibrissae slightly and  distort their connective tissue bedding, rigidify the vibrissal capsules, thus  forming firm bases of attachment for certain facial muscles, and theoretically  provide a pressure plate around the follicle, important in lowering the firing  thresholds of receptor endings. The facial muscles supply the major forces in  erection and protraction of the vibrissae by acting on both the capsules and the  connective tissue bedding. The connective tissues are organized into capsular and  extracapsular systems that serve to stabilize the vibrissae and return them to  initial rest positions. The slight movements of the genal vibrissa are the  effects of vascular and connective tissue dynamics, the musculature being  uninvolved. Wide angle movements of the supraorbital vibrissae are products of  the vasculature and connective tissues, plus contractions of the Mm. orbicularis  oculi and frontalis. Mystacial vibrissal movement is quite complex. The  vasculature supplies a small degree of capsular erection and mystacial pad  distortion, but primarily rigidifies the capsules. The bulk of erection and  protraction is produced by the M. nasolabialis profundus (NLP) and the vibrissal  capsular muscles (VCM). The NLP distorts the mystacial pad; the VCM tilt the  capsules relative to the pad. Retraction is mainly accomplished by elastic  rebound in the pad, this being aided in its extreme degrees by the Mm.  nasolabialis and maxillolabialis. The Mm. nasolabialis superficialis and  buccinator pars orbicularis oris help to spread the vibrissae into a dorsoventral  fan and stabilize the mystacial pad during whisking.",0
