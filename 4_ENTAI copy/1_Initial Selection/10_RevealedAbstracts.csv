4,162,2013,Ontology for heart rate turbulence domain from the conceptual model of SNOMED-CT.,"Electronic health record (EHR) automates the clinician workflow, allowing evidence-based decision support and quality management. We aimed to start a  framework for domain standardization of cardiovascular risk stratification into  the EHR, including risk indices whose calculation involves ECG signal processing.  We propose the use of biomedical ontologies completely based on the conceptual  model of SNOMED-CT, which allows us to implement our domain in the EHR. In this  setting, the present study focused on the heart rate turbulence (HRT) domain,  according to its concise guidelines and clear procedures for parameter  calculations. We used 289 concepts from SNOMED-CT, and generated 19 local  extensions (new concepts) for the HRT specific concepts not present in the  current version of SNOMED-CT. New concepts included averaged and individual  ventricular premature complex tachograms, initial sinus acceleration for  turbulence onset, or sinusal oscillation for turbulence slope. Two representative  use studies were implemented: first, a prototype was inserted in the hospital  information system for supporting HRT recordings and their simple follow up by  medical societies; second, an advanced support for a prospective scientific  research, involving standard and emergent signal processing algorithms in the HRT  indices, was generated and then tested in an example database of 27 Holter  patients. Concepts of the proposed HRT ontology are publicly available through a  terminology server, hence their use in any information system will be  straightforward due to the interoperability provided by SNOMED-CT.",0
5,41,2024,A Longitudinal Investigation of Nasolabial Changes With and Without Revision Surgery in Patients with Non-Syndromic Unilateral Cleft Lip and Palate.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine a baseline of anticipated change in nasolabial appearance following primary repair of unilateral cleft lip/palate and evaluate the degree  to which revision surgery improves nasolabial appearance. DESIGN: Retrospective  chart review. SETTING: Patients treated at the Lancaster Cleft Palate Clinic  interdisciplinary clinic. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with complete  unilateral cleft lip and palate who underwent primary surgical repair and 19  additional patients who underwent subsequent revision surgery were included.  INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the non-revision group underwent a Tennison-Randall  triangular flap lip repair at 3mo. Patients in the revision group underwent a  modification of the Nakajima straight-line repair after primary Tennison-Randall  triangular flap lip repair at an average age of 141mo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A  modification of the Asher-McDade Aesthetic Index was utilized to evaluate  Nasolabial Frontal (NLF), Nasolabial Profile (NLP), Vermillion Border (VB), and  total change in appearance. Scores for patients in the revision group were  evaluated before and after revision while appearance for patients without  revision was evaluated at 3 distinct ages. Scores were averaged across  time-points and inter-rater reliability was assessed. RESULTS: Nasolabial  appearance in the non-revision sample did not change significantly over time,  except for nasal profile. Scores improved after revision surgery - NLP: 3.48 to  2.97, (p = 0.001); NLF: 3.50 to 2.95 (p = 0.001); and Total Nasolabial Score:  3.29 to 3.01 (p = 0.004), with no significant change in VB. CONCLUSION: Decisions  regarding need for nasolabial revision surgery may be made as early as 5yo with  successful outcomes following secondary surgery improving appearance except for  vermillion border appearance.",0
6,172,2003,A patient database application for Hereditary Deafness Epidemiology and Clinical Research (H.E.A.R.): an effort for standardization in multiple languages.,"One of the most challenging and neglected issues in medicine is the effective recording of the data obtained from the patients. The ""European Work Group on the  Genetics of Hearing Impairment,"" which has been working since 1996, proposed a  few questionnaires to collect data regarding the phenotype, ENT findings,  audiological examination findings and other special investigations. In this  study, a computerized patient database application named ""Izmir H.E.A.R version  1.0,"" written in Delphi 4.0 for Windows for recording the patients with hearing  problems, is presented. The application consists of a modular form, including  information about identity, genetic condition, proband query, audiology and  vestibular tests, phenotype, pedigree and special examinations, which allows data  entry on all these issues. It has been developed by using the guidelines of  Hereditary Deafness Epidemiology and Clinical Research (H.E.A.R.) and by the  experience gained within the last 10 years by the authors. The target population  of the program is the ENT clinicians, audiologists, epidemiologists, geneticists  and researchers in the field. The main idea is to create a program serving the  needs of both the daily routine work and research purposes and to distribute this  program to the above-mentioned specialists, to encourage them to try the first  version and to find a standard and/or better way to collect data. For this  reason, the program aims to be multilingual, and the currently available  languages are English, German, Spanish and Turkish.",0

9,121,2022,Significant Vision Recovery from Filler-Induced Complete Blindness with Combined Intra-Arterial Injection of Hyaluronidase and Thrombolytic Agents.,"With the increase of cosmetic injectable hyaluronic acid (HA), there have been more cases with serious complications, including skin necrosis, blindness, and  cerebral embolism. Patients who have recovered from HA filler-induced total  vision loss are extremely rare. We report a case of a 27-year-old female who  developed severe ocular pain on the right side and total vision loss following a  1.0 ml HA filler injection in the nasal dorsum. She arrived at our hospital 4  hours later. Her visual acuity was no light perception (NLP), and she exhibited  eyelid ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and frontal and nasal ecchymosis. She was  promptly treated with subcutaneous and retrobulbar hyaluronidase injections, as  well as intra-arterial 1500 IU hyaluronidase injections into the right ophthalmic  artery with DSA assistance. Her vision improved from NLP to counting fingers at  1.0 meters. Unfortunately, 13 hours later, she felt an intense headache, and her  vision again decreased to NLP. We immediately performed an injection of 1500 IU  hyaluronidase combined with 8 mg alteplase for intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT)  into the right ophthalmic artery. Her vision improved immediately afterward.  After 3 months, her visual acuity had significantly recovered from NLP (admission  vision status) to 20/50 (Snellen chart with glasses). Similarly, skin,  conjunctival, eye movement, and ptosis symptoms completely recovered. This case  demonstrates that reversal of complete blindness due to embolism of the  ophthalmic and central retinal arteries could be accomplished through  multidisciplinary therapies, especially IAT using fibrinolytic agents combined  with hyaluronidase followed by an anticoagulant regimen.Level of evidence VThis  journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

10,82,2023,Can ChatGPT Guide Parents on Tympanostomy Tube Insertion?,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, has introduced a novel avenue for patients to seek medically related  information. This technology holds significant promise in terms of accessibility  and convenience. However, the use of ChatGPT as a source of accurate information  enhancing patient education and engagement requires careful consideration. The  objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and reliability of ChatGPT in  providing information on the indications and management of complications  post-tympanostomy, the most common pediatric procedure in otolaryngology.  METHODS: We prompted ChatGPT-3.5 with questions and compared its generated  responses with the recommendations provided by the latest American Academy of  Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) ""Clinical Practice  Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update)"". RESULTS: A total of 23  responses were generated by ChatGPT against the AAO-HNSF guidelines. Following a  thorough review, it was determined that 22/23 (95.7%) responses exhibited a high  level of reliability and accuracy, closely aligning with the gold standard.  CONCLUSION: Our research study indicates that ChatGPT may be of assistance to  parents in search of information regarding tympanostomy tube insertion and its  clinical implications.",1
11,57,2024,ChatGPT as an information tool in rhinology. Can we trust each other today?,"PURPOSE: ChatGPT (Chat-Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has proven to be a powerful information tool on various topics, including healthcare. This system is  based on information obtained on the Internet, but this information is not always  reliable. Currently, few studies analyze the validity of these responses in  rhinology. Our work aims to assess the quality and reliability of the information  provided by AI regarding the main rhinological pathologies. METHODS: We asked to  the default ChatGPT version (GPT-3.5) 65 questions about the most prevalent  pathologies in rhinology. The focus was learning about the causes, risk factors,  treatments, prognosis, and outcomes. We use the Discern questionnaire and a  hexagonal radar schema to evaluate the quality of the information. We use  Fleiss's kappa statistical analysis to determine the consistency of agreement  between different observers. RESULTS: The overall evaluation of the Discern  questionnaire resulted in a score of 4.05 (± 0.6). The results in the Reliability  section are worse, with an average score of 3.18. (± 1.77). This score is  affected by the responses to questions about the source of the information  provided. The average score for the Quality section was 3.59 (± 1.18). Fleiss's  Kappa shows substantial agreement, with a K of 0.69 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The  ChatGPT answers are accurate and reliable. It generates a simple and  understandable description of the pathology for the patient's benefit. Our team  considers that ChatGPT could be a useful tool to provide information under prior  supervision by a health professional.",1
12,148,2017,Clinical features of visual disturbances secondary to isolated sphenoid sinus inflammatory diseases.,"BACKGROUND: Visual disturbances associated with isolated sphenoid sinus inflammatory diseases (ISSIDs) are easily misdiagnosed due to the nonspecific  symptoms and undetectable anatomical location. The main objective of this  retrospective case series is to investigate the clinical features of visual  disturbances secondary to ISSIDs. METHODS: Clinical data of 23 patients with  unilateral or bilateral visual disturbances secondary to ISSIDs from 2004 to 2014  with new symptoms were collected. Collected data including symptoms, signs,  neuroimaging and pathologic diagnosis were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 14 males  and 9 females, and their ages ranged from 31 to 83 years. Fifteen patients  suffered blurred vision and 11 patients suffered binocular double vision,  including 3 patients who had unilateral visual changes and diplopia  simultaneously. Headache was observed in 18 patients, and orbit pain/ocular pain  in 8 patients. Other presenting symptoms included ptosis (4 patients) and  proptosis (1 patient). Only 5 patients had nasal complaints. The corrected visual  acuities were between NLP to 20/20. Patients with diplopia included 5 with  unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and 6 with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. All  patients performed orbital/sinus/brain radiologic examination and found  responsible lesions in sphenoid sinus. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus  surgery, and 9 patients were found to suffer sphenoid mucocele, 9 with fungal  sinusitis, and 5 with sphenoid sinusitis. Visual disturbances improved in 6  patients, and all the patients with diplopia had a postoperative recovery.  CONCLUSION: Visual disturbances resulting from ISSIDs are relatively uncommon,  but it is crucial that the patient with new vision loss or diplopia and  persistent headache or orbit pain be evaluated for the possibility of ISSIDs  especially before corticosteroid administration.",0
13,108,2022,Early white matter connectivity and plasticity in post stroke aphasia recovery.,"A disruption of white matter connectivity is negatively associated with language (recovery) in patients with aphasia after stroke, and behavioral gains have been  shown to coincide with white matter neuroplasticity. However, most brain-behavior  studies have been carried out in the chronic phase after stroke, with limited  generalizability to earlier phases. Furthermore, few studies have investigated  neuroplasticity patterns during spontaneous recovery (i.e., not related to a  specific treatment) in the first months after stroke, hindering the investigation  of potential early compensatory mechanisms. Finally, the majority of previous  research has focused on damaged left hemisphere pathways, while neglecting the  potential protective value of their right hemisphere counterparts for language  recovery. To address these outstanding issues, we present a longitudinal study of  thirty-two patients with aphasia (21 males and 11 females, M = 69.47 years,  SD = 10.60 years) who were followed up for a period of 1 year with test moments  in the acute (1-2 weeks), subacute (3-6 months) and chronic phase (9-12 months)  after stroke. Constrained Spherical Deconvolution-based tractography was  performed in the acute and subacute phase to measure Fiber Bundle Capacity (FBC),  a quantitative connectivity measure that is valid in crossing fiber regions, in  the bilateral dorsal arcuate fasciculus (AF) and the bilateral ventral inferior  fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). First, concurrent analyses revealed positive  associations between the left AF and phonology, and between the bilateral IFOF  and semantics in the acute - but not subacute - phase, supporting the dual-stream  language model. Second, neuroplasticity analyses revealed a decrease in  connection density of the bilateral AF - but not the IFOF - from the acute to the  subacute phase, possibly reflecting post stroke white matter degeneration in  areas adjacent to the lesion. Third, predictive analyses revealed no contribution  of acute FBC measures to the prediction of later language outcomes over and above  the initial language scores, suggesting no added value ofthe diffusion measures  for languageprediction. Our study provides new insights on (changes in)  connectivity of damaged and undamaged language pathways in patients with aphasia  in the first months after stroke, as well as if/how such measures are related to  language outcomes at different stages of recovery. Individual results are  discussed in the light of current frameworks of language processing and aphasia  recovery.",0
14,135,2021,Automated Detection of Periprosthetic Joint Infections and Data Elements Using Natural Language Processing.,"BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) data elements are contained in both structured and unstructured documents in electronic health records and  require manual data collection. The goal of this study is to develop a natural  language processing (NLP) algorithm to replicate manual chart review for PJI data  elements. METHODS: PJI was identified among all total joint arthroplasty (TJA)  procedures performed at a single academic institution between 2000 and 2017. Data  elements that comprise the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria were  manually extracted and used as the gold standard for validation. A training  sample of 1208 TJA surgeries (170 PJI cases) was randomly selected to develop the  prototype NLP algorithms and an additional 1179 surgeries (150 PJI cases) were  randomly selected as the test sample. The algorithms were applied to all  consultation notes, operative notes, pathology reports, and microbiology reports  to predict the correct status of PJI based on MSIS criteria. RESULTS: The  algorithm, which identified patients with PJI based on MSIS criteria, achieved an  f1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.911. Algorithm performance  in extracting the presence of sinus tract, purulence, pathologic documentation of  inflammation, and growth of cultured organisms from the involved TJA achieved  f1-scores that ranged from 0.771 to 0.982, sensitivity that ranged from 0.730 to  1.000, and specificity that ranged from 0.947 to 1.000. CONCLUSION: NLP-enabled  algorithms have the potential to automate data collection for PJI diagnostic  elements, which could directly improve patient care and augment cohort  surveillance and research efforts. Further validation is needed in other hospital  settings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Diagnostic.",0
15,77,2023,Genetic Discovery Enabled by A Large Language Model.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in many areas of medicine, and recently large language models (LLMs) have shown potential utility for clinical  applications. However, since we do not know if the use of LLMs can accelerate the  pace of genetic discovery, we used data generated from mouse genetic models to  investigate this possibility. We examined whether a recently developed  specialized LLM (Med-PaLM 2) could analyze sets of candidate genes generated from  analysis of murine models of biomedical traits. In response to free-text input,  Med-PaLM 2 correctly identified the murine genes that contained experimentally  verified causative genetic factors for six biomedical traits, which included  susceptibility to diabetes and cataracts. Med-PaLM 2 was also able to analyze a  list of genes with high impact alleles, which were identified by comparative  analysis of murine genomic sequence data, and it identified a causative murine  genetic factor for spontaneous hearing loss. Based upon this Med-PaLM 2 finding,  a novel bigenic model for susceptibility to spontaneous hearing loss was  developed. These results demonstrate Med-PaLM 2 can analyze gene-phenotype  relationships and generate novel hypotheses, which can facilitate genetic  discovery.",1
16,107,2023,Exploring patient experiences and concerns in the online Cochlear implant community: A cross-sectional study and validation of automated topic modelling.,"OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of research examining patient experiences of cochlear implants. We sought to use natural language processing methods to  explore patient experiences and concerns in the online cochlear implant (CI)  community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of posts on the online  Reddit r/CochlearImplants forum from 1 March 2015 to 11 November 2021. Natural  language processing using the BERTopic automated topic modelling technique was  employed to cluster posts into semantically similar topics. Topic categorisation  was manually validated by two independent reviewers and Cohen's kappa calculated  to determine inter-rater reliability between machine vs human and human vs human  categorisation. RESULTS: We retrieved 987 posts from 588 unique Reddit users on  the r/CochlearImplants forum. Posts were initially categorised by BERTopic into  16 different Topics, which were increased to 23 Topics following manual  inspection. The most popular topics related to CI connectivity (n = 112), adults  considering getting a CI (n = 107), surgery-related posts (n = 89) and day-to-day  living with a CI (n = 85). Cohen's kappa among all posts was 0.62 (machine vs.  human) and 0.72 (human vs. human), and among categorised posts was 0.85 (machine  vs. human) and 0.84 (human vs. human). CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study of  social media discussions among the online cochlear implant community identified  common attitudes, experiences and concerns of patients living with, or seeking, a  cochlear implant. Our validation of natural language processing methods to  categorise topics shows that automated analysis of similar Otolaryngology-related  content is a viable and accurate alternative to manual qualitative approaches.",1
17,12,2025,Automated Evaluation of Antibiotic Prescribing Guideline Concordance in Pediatric Sinusitis Clinical Notes.,"BACKGROUND: Ensuring antibiotics are prescribed only when necessary is crucial for maintaining their effectiveness and is a key focus of public health  initiatives worldwide. In cases of sinusitis, among the most common reasons for  antibiotic prescriptions in children, healthcare providers must distinguish  between bacterial and viral causes based on clinical signs and symptoms. However,  due to the overlap between symptoms of acute sinusitis and viral upper  respiratory infections, antibiotics are often over-prescribed. OBJECTIVES:  Currently, there are no electronic health record (EHR)-based methods, such as lab  tests or ICD-10 codes, to retroactively assess the appropriateness of  prescriptions for sinusitis, making manual chart reviews the only available  method for evaluation, which is time-intensive and not feasible at a large scale.  In this study, we propose using natural language processing to automate this  assessment. METHODS: We developed, trained, and evaluated generative models to  classify the appropriateness of antibiotic prescriptions in 300 clinical notes  from pediatric patients with sinusitis seen at a primary care practice in the  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia network. We utilized standard prompt  engineering techniques, including few-shot learning and chain-of-thought  prompting, to refine an initial prompt. Additionally, we employed  Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning to train a medium-sized generative model Llama 3  70B-instruct. RESULTS: While parameter-efficient fine-tuning did not enhance  performance, the combination of few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting  proved beneficial. Our best results were achieved using the largest generative  model publicly available to date, the Llama 3.1 405B-instruct. On our evaluation  set, the model correctly identified 94.7% of the 152 notes where antibiotic  prescription was appropriate and 66.2% of the 83 notes where it was not  appropriate. However, 15 notes that were insufficiently, vaguely, or ambiguously  documented by physicians posed a challenge to our model, as none were accurately  classified. CONCLUSION: Our generative model demonstrated good performance in the  challenging task of chart review. This level of performance may be sufficient for  deploying the model within the EHR, where it can assist physicians in real-time  to prescribe antibiotics in concordance with the guidelines, or for monitoring  antibiotic stewardship on a large scale.",1
18,68,2023,NLP AI Models for Optimizing Medical Research: Demystifying the Concerns.,"Natural language processing (NLP) AI models have gained popularity in research; however, ethical considerations are necessary to avoid potential negative  consequences. This paper identifies and explores the key areas of ethical concern  for researchers using NLP AI models, such as bias in training data and  algorithms, plagiarism, data privacy, accuracy of generated content, prompt and  content generation, and training data quality. To mitigate bias, researchers  should use diverse training data and regularly evaluate models for potential  biases. Proper attribution and privacy protection are essential when using  AI-generated content, while accuracy should be regularly tested and evaluated.  Specific and appropriate prompts, algorithms, and techniques should be used for  content generation, and training data quality should be high, diverse, and  updated regularly. Finally, appropriate authorship credit and avoidance of  conflicts of interest must be ensured. Adherence to ethical standards, such as  those outlined by ICMJE, is crucial. These ethical considerations are vital for  ensuring the quality and integrity of NLP AI model research and avoiding negative  consequences.",0
19,34,2024,How to obtain product green design requirements based on sentiment analysis and topic analysis: Using washing machine online reviews as an example.,"Green design involves the entire life cycle of a product, including stages such as raw material acquisition, production and manufacturing, sales and  transportation, use, recycling, and disposal. Extracting customer requirements  (CRs) related to product green design (PGD) is one of the necessary conditions  for achieving the dual carbon goal. However, only a few studies have evaluated  CRs for PGD from a full life cycle perspective. This study obtained 20,000 online  reviews of washing machines from e-commerce platforms. The customers' sentiment  tendencies toward the requirements of washing machines at various stages of their  life cycle are analyzed and evaluated. The CRs contained in online washing  machine reviews were identified through cluster analysis. Based on the life cycle  theory, the product green design requirements (PGDRs) of CRs were extracted and  analyzed. This study can provide theoretical and methodological support for green  product design.",0
20,110,2022,Guideline for the treatment of no light perception eyes induced by mechanical ocular trauma.,"Severe mechanical ocular trauma with no light perception (NLP) predicts a poor prognosis of visual acuity and enucleation of the eyeball. Since the innovative  treatment concept of exploratory vitreoretinal surgery has developed and  treatment technology has advanced, the outcomes of severe ocular trauma treatment  in NLP patients have greatly improved. However, there remains a lack of unified  standards for the determination, surgical indication, and timing of vitrectomy in  NLP eye treatment. To address these problems, we aimed to create evidence-based  medical guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of mechanical  ocular trauma with NLP. Sixteen relevant recommendations for mechanical ocular  trauma with NLP were obtained, and a consensus was reached. Each recommendation  was explained in detail to guide the treatment of mechanical ocular trauma  associated with NLP.",0
