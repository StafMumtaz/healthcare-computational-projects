# Healthcare Computational Projects

## Overview
This is a repository made soley for my Palantir application to demonstrate 
some code in previous healthcare and neuroscience related computational
projects. Code will not function directly from repository but will contain 
demonstrations of inputs and outputs.

## Projects Included

### Project 1: Mandala
- **Description:** Self-directed app built to call on GPT 3.5 API to learn coding skills in the context of neuroscience and psychology.
- **Status:** Functioning buttons, menu, and API calls. Development discontinued upon securing lab computational role. 
- **Folder:** `1_Mandala`

### Project 2: Flight Initiation Distace
- **Description:** MATLAB Application designed to assess threat and reward processing in uncertainty. 
- **Status:** Completed and administered. 
- **Files:** `FID_5.m` in folder `2_FID`

### Project 3: Brain White Matter Comparison in Depression Patients
- **Description:** Series of scripts used to generate statistical tests from MRI scans. 
- **Status:** Completed and ran on patient data. 
- **Files:** `FSLpipeline.ipynb` in folder `3_FSL`

### Project 4: Natural Language Processing in Otolaryngology
- **Description:** Series of scripts utilizing Claude and OpenAI APIs to help automate study selection and analysis for thousands of papers.
- **Status:** Complete, truncated form of final script included.
- **Files:** `ENTNLP.ipynb` in folder `4_ENTNLP`

**Ending Note:** All the works included were almost entirely built by myself using online resources like AI. Project 2, FID, involved some advising and contributions from a mentor.
