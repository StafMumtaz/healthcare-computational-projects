# FID Overview

This was a game developed in MATLAB to assess electrophysiological activity in the brain as it calculates changes in rewards, threat, and surprise.  
This game was completed and deployable with a single button when initially administered. 
It was used on patients to collect extracranial brain records and eye movements with plans of intracranial recordings. 

A slideshow **demonstration:** showing initial sections of the game began for patients can be found in folder under `FID Storyboard.pdf`

## Description
The patients control the yellow triangle. They are the **prey**
The grey circle is the **predator**
The game has multiple iterated rounds, where the **predator** moves towards the **prey**
The player is rewarded with points translating to small cash prize for the longer they remain in the screen.
They can escape in time and keep limited points, or remain to gain more, at the risk of losing all from the **predator**. 
The **predator** speeds up at points along a normal distribution in the game field, forcing guess work. 

Midway through the game, rules change to assess brain adaptation to context switching. 

This game adapted and rethought analogues methods used in neuroscience research.
