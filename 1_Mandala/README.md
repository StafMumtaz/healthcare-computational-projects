# Mandala Overview

This application was developed purely for self-education and signalling to research labs.  
(It was built in the weeks leading up to September 2023.)

The app creates a user interface in Swift, with functioning buttons, a sidebar, and a text interface.  
It sends user queries to a GPT-3.5 API, has the API identify categories of inquiries related to psychiatry information,  
and then responds with something simulating therapy or, in some cases, educational information.
